It’s conveniently located on the same route, making it a great stopover.

The stream gently flows downhill, forming a series of cascading rock pools connected like natural steps. You can relax in any of them, though the lower pools tend to be more popular. The water is deep in parts, which makes it ideal for floating with a pool noodle or even jumping in from the rock ledges.

It’s a peaceful spot to unwind, soak in the beauty of nature, and enjoy the cool, clear waters in a more low-key setting. A wonderful stop in Litchfield that feels both refreshing and serene.",2 months ago,06-08-2025,-13.1118587,130.7876454,water swim swimming pools,0.9929

Three things struck me: Firstly,  I was delighted and inspired when he strode through the staff access door with his huge hat and equally huge grin. What struck me specifically was, for all his outer success and obvious promotion and impact on Darwin and the Territory's image nationally and internationally, that he was so present, unpretentious,  modest and genuinely interested in discussing the work and relating the stories associated with each work...

Secondly, when then going onto his internet site, the integrity and congruence between the man, his vocation and his authentic and articulate communication of his inspiration.

Lastly...his assemblage of 'The Territory' Akubras (please correct me if I'm wrong) in the window. A soulfully rugged poetic and enduring symbol of a well-marketed yet gratefully real and talented Territory artisan.

Moving now from the Crocodile Islands and Groote Eylandt to Tasmania there's a Paul Arnold work scheduled to be a part of my Tasmanian home to quintessentially capture the heart and spirit of the Territory.

It is expansive, so you will get an excellent workout as it is set on a hilly slope - find a layout map if you want to get through it all.

Notable section is the Madagascar & African garden with massive Baob trees incl the local native Adansonia Gregorii.

Waterfall has not worked for quite awhile & it is evident parts of the garden is neglected. Interesting tropical trees like Ashoka Seraca (religious significance to Buddhists), toxic Suicide Tree (Cerberus Odallam) - up there with Death Cap mushies 🫣, Pride of Burma Amhertsia, Black Bean Moreton chestnut tree, Sausage Tree (er.. rr..true - from Africa) & quite few others used in perfumes, medicinal oils or just plain quirky.

Main entrance is actually across the road from Mindil Sunset Beach area - look for Eva's Cafe on google which is just past  entrance. Interesting sculptures scattered around, some good & others like the dinosaurs in the cycad area plain garish (cast off from elsewhere). The Centre is worth a visit for background & seed saving history. We spotted a Rufuos Owl & you will see & hear the ubiquitous native scrubfowls.

There are two access options: a steep staircase of around 130 steps or a longer, stair-free path that’s more accessible. We visited around midday on a Tuesday — it was fairly busy, but still plenty of space to enjoy the water.

The twin waterfalls aren’t immediately visible from the viewing area, but once you’re in the pool, they reveal themselves beautifully. The swim to the falls is short and manageable — unlike Wangi or Edith Falls, which require a longer swim. I’d highly recommend bringing a pool noodle (a Territory essential!) as the water is deep and it makes floating much more relaxing.

Sitting beneath the falls with water cascading over you was incredibly refreshing. For the adventurous, there are rock ledges nearby to climb and jump from. There’s also a calm, shallow creek off to the side for a more laid-back experience.

The first mass I attended, I got introduced to the Aboriginal Our Father and it was different but another beautiful form of the same prayer. I didn't hear it the 2nd and 3rd time, so it has become a treasured memory.

At the end of mass, they ask the church goers to help close the doors—there are over 50! It reminds me of the churches in the Philippines, open on all sides for people to come in from all directions.

I also always get the Vietnamese pork skewers and paw paw salad—so yummy:) The smoothie and juice stalls are beautiful too; perfect for something cool and refreshing when it's starting to warm up.

It does get busy, but parking is usually okay if you arrive early or don’t mind walking a little. Dogs aren’t allowed in the market area, which is a shame if you’re bringing your pup along—but good to know ahead of time.

Recounts not only the origins of the crucial medical & allied health services Australia's Flying Doctors Services provide to the remote & inaccessible outback regions but also the WW2 Bombing of Darwin from a different perspective.

After half day tour of Darwin's WW2 bombarment the day prior, I should have been fatigued by overload of info on this subject matter but not! The VR & holographic presentations are brief & totally ""eye witness"" immersive experience not to be missed.

Excellent & moving tribute to essential services RFDS provides to health & mental well-being of remote communities. The origin of this service by Rev. John Flynn & others who contributed is illuminating as is the association with Quensland & NT Aerial Services (Qantas). The VR that showcases this section is in 2 parts: one takes you soaring over the red centre of this continent with pilot's narrative.  2nd: you are in the plane in an emergency situation with a real patient (not confronting). A sensory appreciation for the services & skills of highly trained nurse & navigating pilot. Explore the interior of an actual RFDS plane.

Facilty staff are very welcoming & helpful with suggestions on how best to utilise your 1.5 to 2 hours here.

A free courtesy shuttle bus operates to pick up & drop off in front of facilty from 11.30 am onwards every 15 mins (check the post outside for times & locations).  Operates only from upper areas to this lower Wharf facility which is quite an uphill climb to return.  Was almost 2km walk from my hotel middle of Esplanade to get down here but an eye pleasing cliff edge scenic walk heading towards Darwin Waterfront via Skybridge.

Got here just after 9.00 am opening y'day Sun 27/7/25.  Much quieter! Avoid VR strap on after a sweaty walk - fogs up the lenses ☺️. Courtesy wipes & sanitisers provided for before & after use. Excellent gift shop here.

The same Japanese commander who led the attack on Pearl Harbour twice launched the first two raids on Darwin. It stopped at two for Pearl Harbour but Darwin was bombarded for a total of 64 times until Nov 1943 with hundreds of casualties & massive annihilation... Little known historical facts to most Australians, me included until this first revelatory visit to Darwin. Bit ashamed really, Darwin's history has flown under radar & for some reason until fairly recently, did not make into school curriculum. Even Kidman is supposed to have professed that until the movie ""Australia"" with scenes of Darwin's aerial raids - she was not aware of Darwin's bombardment in WW2 Pacific's war.

We booked a day fishing for our family of 5 for $1950. 6pm the night before we were told we would not be picked up and must drive 1.5hrs to the boat ramp.

After I reversed the charter boat into to water and parked the trailer at the request of the operator....We spent 5-6 hours fishing between 8am until 3pm. My family was not provided with any substantial food over this time, although I was under the impression it would be provided. Only 1 bag or Doritos and 1 bag of lollies. To be fair there were cold drinks available which was nice.

We caught one fish which was great!

The operator spent a good portion of the day dealing with his business affairs on the phone, or with his colleagues on the other larger boat that was present.

The operator was also telling me about his disagreements with other tour operators and swearing about/at them in front of our children. The boat was quite dirty from the fishing charter that had been operated the day before and there was no shade on board.

At the end of the day we gave the other employees (from the larger boat) a lift back to the boat ramp on our charter boat and we even had to turn back for 20 minutes when one of them forgot his phone! Overall it didn't feel like a very special experience for the money, the company hadn't put any effort into making it an enjoyable experience for my family and I would not recommend Wildman Fishing Tours.

""Prior to the Stuart Highway upgrade during World War II, visitors to Darwin usually arrived by ship.

""From at least as early as the 1880s, passengers disembarked at the Port of Darwin and climbed the escarpment via the walkway to town known colloquially as Chinamans' or Travellers' Walk.

""The path began at the entrance to the railway yards with steps up to Cavenagh Street and finished at the Terminus Hotel. There, shaded by the great banyan tree, ironically dubbed the Tree of Knowledge, drinkers sat debating the issues of the day. This was the seaward end of Chinatown and the commercial centre of the town, now the site of the Darwin Civic Centre.

""The name of the walkway came about, in part, because Chinese stonemasons, skilled at working with porcellanite, constructed the original pathway and steps. The name was also in recognition of the many people who used it. In the nineteenth century many Chinese. prospectors came north from goldfields elsewhere in Australia and from southern China. Until 1911, there were more Chinese than Europeans in the Top End of the Territory and they made up a vital part of the economy and character of the town.

""Photographic evidence shows that the path zigzagged its way up the hill. The route has changed over more than a century of use and has been, at different times, wider, fenced and eventually concreted.""",10 months ago,11-11-2024,-12.465391,130.84737,darwin of to the,0.6705

SAFETY:
1. Staying with a group, myself and others were given master keys (without asking). They opened every room in the place. BEWARE that total strangers have keys to your room.
2. The pool has no lighting. Trying to supervise kids past dark is very difficult and dangerous, since you can't see anyone. (See photo)
3. The place is overall very dark. It feels unfinished. I'd feel unsafe here if I was a solo traveller.

VALUE:
Extremely poor value. Go stay at Darwin resort for at least 1/2 the price for better service. They lie to you and say that continental breakfast is included, and then come to charge you after your whole group has eaten ($16 / person for cereal and a couple low quality options and instant coffee).

They even charge for laundry, and even though there's a tap-to-pay sign, it only takes coins.

Even though it is relatively new, the whole place is falling apart. Cracked paint, cheap veneer doors peeling apart, etc.

I was here for almost a week, my bedsheets were never changed. The bathroom was never cleaned. Some days I didn't even get fresh towels.

Also you need a car if you're staying out this far. Door Dash won't even deliver because it's out of town.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
I could go on an on about the issues during my stay, and all of them were somehow twisted to be blamed on myself and our group. I asked repeatedly to speak with a manager for days, and never got to.

They have a ""no refund"" policy, even if they give you rooms without working aircon or key cards. Pitiful for the price they're charging.

The positives:
The rooms are big and the pools are nice in the daytime.

Adina charged us unfairly and left us with a toddler sleeping in the lobby.

30the September update :
Thank you for your written response. However, I must strongly disagree with the version of events presented. At no point were we advised that staying past 1:00pm would result in being charged at double the hourly late check-out rate. What was communicated to us was simply $30 per hour after 11:00am, which we accepted verbally. The extra $60 charge was applied unilaterally, without our consent or even being informed at the time — only discovered on our invoice. The amount isn’t even the issue, it’s the lack of communication and the attitude of the duty manager.

Further, your response does not acknowledge the real inconvenience we faced as parents of a toddler. My wife vacated the room prior to 1:00pm, and our 18-month-old child had to be put to sleep in the lobby while we sorted things out. This was extremely uncomfortable and stressful, yet no assistance or empathy was offered by your team.

We understand and respect standard hotel policies and check-out procedures. What we are disappointed by is the lack of clear communication, the rigid approach taken despite the circumstances, and the absence of basic courtesy that one expects in the service industry.

We sincerely hope Senior management will reflect on this feedback and take it as an opportunity to improve both transparency and guest care going forward.",in the last week,30-09-2025,-12.4663543,130.8470458,she order my me,0.6074

The air-conditioned function room was spacious, clean, and beautifully lit with natural light, which made it super comfortable for both kids and adults (especially in Darwin’s heat!). The location is ideal, easy for guests to get to, with plenty of parking and a relaxed, tropical vibe as soon as you enter the resort.

We had external vendors come in to set up soft play and decorations, and the team at FreeSpirit was so flexible and accommodating—nothing was too hard, and they really helped take the stress out of the day. Every staff member we spoke to was friendly, professional, and genuinely supportive. You can tell they care about their guests having a great experience.

The food was delicious and came out exactly on time—hot, fresh, and with generous portions. We had so many compliments from our guests!

Whether you’re hosting a birthday, baby shower, or any type of event, I can’t recommend Darwin FreeSpirit Resort enough. The atmosphere is chilled but polished, and it’s a place where you can truly enjoy the moment while the team takes care of the rest.

I witnessed two of the female staff rolling their eyes and side eyeing customers multiple times when being asked simple questions by customers even the one taking orders on the headset. My poor mom decided last minute that she wanted egg in her salad (after already paying) which I was more than happy to pay for and the male staff said ‘How am I going to charge you for that??? Just for egg??’ As if I was supposed to know what he should do… I will have to charge you a 6inch sub’. I wouldn’t know but wouldn’t it have been possible to charge for a few cookies to make up for it? It was such a simple request but he made it a big deal.

I was polite and said thank you over and over hoping it would turn their mood around but idk why I bothered honestly.

Judging by the other reviews almost everyone seems to feel the same lol but seems like nothing is being done to change anything.

This sushi spot is a haven for those who cherish the delicate balance of sushi rice paired with the freshest ingredients.

The California roll and  prawn tempura sushi roll I had the pleasure of tasting were nothing short of perfection. Each roll was crafted with precision, ensuring that every bite was a harmonious blend of flavors. The sushi rice was seasoned impeccably, complementing the succulence of the prawn tempura and the creamy texture of the avocado in the California roll.

Despite its compact size, the store is ingeniously designed to welcome a steady flow of sushi enthusiasts. It's a place where the focus is solely on the takeout experience, ensuring that each order is given the attention it deserves. The absence of tables and chairs speaks to the on-the-go nature of the city life, catering to customers who appreciate quality food in the comfort of their own space.

The charm of this sushi spot is not just in its food but also in its unassuming presence. It's a place you might miss if you're not looking closely, but once discovered, it becomes a regular pitstop. The only regret one might have is not ordering more – a sentiment I share deeply, wishing I had indulged in just a few more of those delightful rolls.

In conclusion, this sushi establishment is an essential destination for those in pursuit of a genuine and exquisite sushi adventure.

The soul of ramen is the soup, and just one sip of this soup makes it clear that it’s made from soup powder rather than simmered pork bones. It also leaves an extremely thirsty feeling after drinking, which suggests an excessive amount of MSG—already a bad sign.
Next, the noodles—completely lacking the aroma of eggs, overly soft from soaking too long, and not chewy at all. It’s no different from cooking instant Nissin ramen from the supermarket at home.
Then there’s the so-called “wagyu.” Seeing wagyu on the menu was initially exciting since most Japanese ramen comes with pork or chicken chashu. But this wagyu was a massive disappointment—tough, chewy, and lacking any beef aroma. It felt like a piece of boiled beef brisket that had just been taken out of a soup pot. After two bites, I couldn’t eat any more.
The soft-boiled egg wasn’t runny, but at least it wasn’t fully cooked, so I guess that’s passable.
I understand that this is Darwin, and I wouldn’t expect the ramen quality to match Japan’s, but when it’s worse than simply buying Nissin ramen and beef from the supermarket to cook at home, it’s really not worth the price.",6 months ago,28-03-2025,-12.4630284,130.842161,chinese fried food rice,-0.894

As you can see from the photos, it's a beautiful venue, with so much potential.

Pre-covid, this was a pleasant restaurant with a good menu. The standards, service and overall quality have fallen since they re-opened post-covid.

The menu online does not reflect what's actually available. The service is slow (I've only ever seen one person occasionally present for the staff, often you have to seek someone after sitting in an empty restaurant for 5+ minutes), and the food is adequate at best. Their steak ordered medium rare was more medium-done. They advertise wagyu on their website but only standard supermarket steak in reality.

The only redeeming feature is they are part of the AccorPlus program, so up to 50% off food.

I really wish they'd put more effort into this restaurant, there is so much potential. Even just reaching pre-covid standards would be nice.

A pleasant swimup bar, only available to guests at the Mindil Beach Resort/hotel (formerly Skycity). Ideally you'd get a lagoon room which direct balcony access to the lagoon, but staying in the standard hotel area will still give you access.

I'd love to rate this place higher, unfortunately two factors hold it back:

1) lack of flexibility in the menu
2) cost of drinks.

I understand that hotels are expensive in general, but the cocktails here, while well made, are priced at Singapore levels (ie. extremely expensive). I think these might be the most expensive cocktails in Darwin!

As for flexibility, asking for a martini, seeing that they have all the ingredients at the bar, and being denied saying they only serve whats on the official menu, is disappointing, especially given the high cost of drinks.

I don't know whether to recommend it, but if you can't make Bali, then this is an acceptable 2nd choice.

We booked a table for 2 online which was easy. The vibe is pretty young & hip, including the music, although the meals could easily cater to a variety of ages. Thete is an extensive menu & drinks list. We ordered 5 different tapas, which were all delicious! The staff were all very attentive & organised. Although we will happily award a well deserved 5 star rating, a couple of small pieces of constructive criticism though; we thought the music didn't suit the international / spanish / culture & style of the restaurant. And the order that we received our tapas was not in the order of how they were found on the menu, & felt the order in which the items were listed should have reasonably reflected the order in which they were enjoyed.
We felt the prices were very resonable for the high level of the food & service. Definitely a centrally located restaurant to visit and enjoy whilst in Darwin.

You might be wondering why I’m giving Palmerston Tavern a full 5 stars!! well, let me tell you why.

First of all, the customer service was exceptional. I wish I remembered the lovely lady’s name, but she was incredibly kind, attentive, and welcoming — the kind of service that makes you feel right at home from the moment you walk in.

Now, onto the food... where do I even begin?! I ordered the rib fillet with salad, chips, and pepper gravy, and let me just say... WOW. It wasn’t just a meal; it was an experience. The steak was cooked to absolute perfection — tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The pepper gravy was rich, velvety, and packed with just the right amount of kick, elevating every bite. Honestly, the combination took me straight back to my childhood, those comforting, hearty meals that warm your soul.

If you're in the mood for a proper grilled steak or meat dish, Palmerston Tavern is the place to be. It’s not just good, it’s unforgettable.

To the chefs: give yourselves a pat on the back or better yet, a raise!

Their woodfired pizzas 🍕 and handmade pastas 🍝 are top-notch, with the beef ragu pasta being a standout dish—rich, hearty, and full of flavour. The mains are equally impressive, but the real star of the menu is the CSG cocktail (CLARENZ Special Gin) 🍸 – hands down the most refreshing and perfectly balanced drink on offer. It’s a must-try.

The atmosphere is relaxed yet refined ✨, and the service is always on point. Special mention to Dustine, the restaurant manager – an absolute legend 🙌 who’ll always find you a table, even when it’s packed.

If there’s one area for improvement, it would be the steak offering 🥩. A better selection of premium cuts, especially something for sharing like a wagyu bone-in ribeye, would take the menu to the next level.

On the positive side, the young lady playing guitar really carried the vibe of the place, creating a lively country atmosphere that made the evening enjoyable. The location is fantastic, right at the waterfront, with nice alfresco seating that offers a lovely view of the pool and grassed area. It’s definitely a spot where people gather to enjoy good music and drinks.

However, the food left something to be desired. I ordered chicken wings that were significantly overcooked, to the point where the meat wouldn’t separate from the bone. The burger was exceptional, but I had to remove the bacon since it was uncooked.

While the staff were extremely friendly, my table was unpleasantly sticky, which detracted from the overall experience.

Despite the food issues, I appreciate the good price of the burger & chips at $22, as well as the regular musical entertainment. I would consider returning, but I’ll be more careful in choosing my meal next time.

It was an okay meal, the prawns and rice were great - we just wished it came with more sauce. So much left over rice with no sauce to eat it with.

In my opinion the steak (surf n turf) was cooked beautifully, the prawns were cooked nicely too, and the gravy was awesome! I just wished I ordered more fries instead of salad.

The Territory Taste Platter is not worth ordering again. At all. The Crocodile fillet was incredible, I wish that could of been a meal on its own. We need more places in Darwin that offer more Crocodile options!! However the reason im giving it a 4 stars is because the kangaroo tasted absolutely awful, we couldnt finish it. The salad was just bad. Im so sorry, maybe I came on a bad day, but the mango dressing just doesn't go well with the salad. I feel like the mango dressing should be an option, as most people (myself included) aren't big on having fruit in salads alongside savoury meals, but thats just my opinion.

Let's start with what was good.. the pancake machine and tinned peaches.
At least I could tell these items were fresh.

The rest was borderline depressing for a large hotel chain's breakfast offerings.
Is someone reusing last night's dinner for today's breakfast?, because that is the vibe I got. The offerings are just odd and not done well at all.
Carrots in the mushrooms
Kransky in some strange vegetation mix
Uncooked tomatoes 🍅
What looked like last night's dry old noodles.
Dumplings undercooked and oily.
Not only did these offerings taste sad, they also were cold.. not even at safe food temp which I feel is pretty easy to accomplish.
The cold side offered:
Dry cracked cheese slices and rubbery ham.
Croissants that had become almost stone like.
Tinned and some fresh fruit.. the cold side definitely felt safer to eat. The yougurt however was lumpy and watery all at the same time so maybe avoid that.

There was so much false advertising for this hotel and we were very disappointed,

There is no bar or restaurant attached when we booked we were under the impression that there would be a buffet breakfast available at the restaurant and bar attached to the hotel, they aren't open so instead we where given 3 options a day at a local cafe down stairs and around the corner, while it was nice after 9 days it got boring and we weren't allowed to use the vouchers for any other meals so we ended up loosing money and giving them to the staff at the Rydges to use.

We had to pay an extra $29 per night for car parking, the card details were taken upon check in and since leaving we keep receiving phone calls about payment when it has already been paid for! It shouldn't cost any extra to park as it is.

The pool is very small and doesn't look at all like the photos online.

The shower didn't drain properly so had to stand in about an inch of water during a shower and no body wash was in the container.

The beds were really uncomfortable and my back was killing me the whole time we stayed there.

There isn't even a microwave available to use in the room. No cutlery to make anything we had to buy plastic knives and forks.

When they clean your room they don't clean the room properly. We had to ask for extra toilet paper after they had already been.

There was some confusion over whether breakfast was included in our room rate - we thought it was but some of my travelling companions were charged for breakfast. The breakfast offerings were reasonable. I had dinner at the restaurant on my first night and was given the wrong dish and had to wait a long time (and follow up with the staff) before I got the vegetarian penne I had ordered.

Check-in set the tone — total chaos, like walking into a Dance Moms convention with Honey Boo Boo and JonBenét Ramsey lookalikes running wild. Not exactly the calm welcome you’d expect from a Hilton.

The pool is in serious need of a revamp (see photos) — tired, small, and not at all what you’d expect from a Hilton charging premium rates. By contrast, I’d just spent three nights at the DoubleTree for half the price and had a far better experience.

The worst part was departure day. With a late-night flight, I asked if I could use the lounge to refresh or send emails after a day trip to Litchfield. At every other Hilton I’ve stayed at, this has been a simple yes. Here, it was a hard no. I ended up going back to the DoubleTree, where they were far more accommodating (and frankly kinder).

The one highlight was Gabriel in the lounge — genuinely excellent service, and he makes a fantastic whiskey sour. A small bright spot in an otherwise disappointing stay.

The room was a comfortable size for two, with ample walking space and spots to relax, whether at the kitchen table or on the lounge chair before the bed. There’s also a shared balcony that overlooks the car park.

The apartment itself is a little dated, and you can see signs of age with some stains here and there. Still, we were surprised to find a fairly new washing machine and dryer tucked inside the bathroom - definitely a bonus, though there was no washing powder provided (likely something to purchase at reception). The shower area was on the smaller side, and water pressure was quite low, which was the main downside.

The kitchen came well-equipped for basic cooking, and the fridge even had a jar of ice water ready, which was perfect for Darwin’s hot weather. On the downside, one of the cups had a stain, and there was noticeable dust on the microwave and stools. I just gave the stool a quick wipe before using it. The knives weren’t in the best shape either—one had rust on the edge and another was so dented it looked like it had been used to chop a crocodile!

Amenities included soap, shampoo, and conditioner, but no tissue paper—we ended up using toilet paper instead. There was also no hair dryer in the room. Towels were provided, but they left lint on our clothes. On the second day, fresh towels were placed on the table, though not all used ones were cleared away.

Housekeeping was inconsistent. They brought towels even when we didn’t request them, but bins weren’t always cleared—on one occasion, only two out of three were emptied.

Wi-Fi was weak; with just two devices connected, it was already stuttering. The air-conditioning unit was another issue—it leaked whenever set at 25 degrees or lower, so we had to place a bin underneath to catch the dripping water. We highlighted this to Dolly at reception during checkout on 29 September at 8:30 am.

Location-wise, it’s very convenient. Mindil Beach Sunset Market is just a 5-minute drive or a 20-minute walk away, and fast food options like McDonald’s, KFC, and Guzman are within a 3-minute drive.

Good reserved secure parking on site with high clearance. Shower pressure is VERY low, feels like showering under a trickle. You will hear other people banging around in other rooms till quite late.

✅ Rooms are an ok size for one person.
✅ Rooms and common areas all tidy and clean.
✅ Extra pillows.
✅ Cold Airconditioning.
✅ Affordably priced.
✅ Secure, Reserved parking with high clearance.
✅ Staff are friendly and informative.
✅ Woolworths next door makes food shopping a breeze.

CONS:
❌ Shower pressure is a complete joke, it's a trickle at best, very disappointing.
❌ Bed is not amazing. Sprung mattress with a less than ideal topper, not /bad/, but nothing to write home about.
❌ You will hear other people banging around in their apartments till late.
❌ Some local NT residents were having a screaming match out in the street on night 1.
❌ Nothing super close restaurant wise. Either walking a fair bit, driving or getting delivery.

Pros:
# Location
# Reception staff helpful
# Safe & secure with 2 security coded cards for building & room entry.

Cons:
#Old & dated air-con drone will keep you awake. Light sleepers beware! I got used to it, thankfully. Any longer - I'd sue for audio impairment! Cool enough but no thermostat remote control.
# Soft pillows & bit saggy bed. Ok for me but pax two will test the firmness & comfort.
# Clean but dated bathroom with darkened grouting here & there. All looks adequate on arrival. However with room service policy only on 7th day - it becomes annoying. Paying premium for hotel service but treated like an apartment stay. With Darwin's heat & humidity - the towels are used frequently & need changing. Sheets are not changed either which did not bother me much.
#Shower is in bathtub & old style deep. Those with mobility issues need to be careful. Handrail is attached.
# Trot down to reception to replenish tea or coffee bags. One cup & spoon provided in a pax 2 room. Figure how stained that gets by the 5th day - washing with hand wash & no scrub..
#You are expected to clear the bins by getting down to the basement!! Hello!!
You come for a holiday hoping to get away from domestic duties. Pay the peak season hotel room rate only to be subjected to house work & irritations that detracts from relaxation.

Accor chain need to address this. Stayed at Uluru in July 2023 in one of their premium resort hotels & found it in the same state of very low upkeep & maintenance. Fake reviews to prop up ratings.

However, it's in dire need of a renovation. The first thing you see when you walk in to the concierge is the crumbled, peeling drywall under the vent in the foyer. Our apartment had busted drywall throughout, the ceiling in the laundry was caving in and the tiles in the kitchen were broken and chipped.

During our stay the main toilet stopped being able to flush, we notified the concierge who said a plumber would be there by 10am the same day. No plumber ever came, not for the remaining 4 days of our stay either.

One thing that stood out in this establishment were the staff.
They were always accommodating, patient and friendly.
I noticed 4 different groups of cleaning staff go through in the time we were there.
Some of the cleaners were conscientious and thorough at least half were not.
The room we were in needed a good deep cleaning, the mattress was a hammock and needed replacing, we went through 2 clothes dryers, the sliding door to the balcony had to have its rollers replaced as it was impossible to open.
Kitchen utensils were well past their use by dates, plastic cooking utensils just aren’t very useful.
I personally cleaned the aircon filters twice, the globes for the range hood kept blowing out, the noise from units above us was on occasions extremely annoying, being of concrete construction the whole place reverberates with sound and sonic repercussion.

We have stayed in other Quest outlets around Australia, and have come to expect the equivalent standard of excellence and so the experience of living in the Palmerston establishment for an extended period was an eye opener in that the delivery of service, varies from one location to another.

As I aforementioned, the staff were excellent and in our case, that will suffice.

The negative would be the service.

On top of that, we felt the morning breakfast in the Mercure was usually cold, cramped and busy and the general service from the workers was just quite grumpy and non hospitable. There was one really nice waitress who stood out massively.

- the elevator needs to be serviced, it sounds like it's just gonna get stuck
- the stairwell needed more lights and more signage
- the carpet was just stained
- had dirty towels and dirty linens
-  the bathroom door had stains near the handle
- when fresh hand towels was returned they was dirty

- on the website it had room service
But there was no phone or menu so had to go down stairs
- no microwave to reheat food so it ended up being a lot of take out

- the sounding of the rooms wasn't great  and others just kept going in and out all hours slamming the doors every time. Which then woke me up every time.

- the locking on the doors it self needs to be upgraded to a safer model

When we asked, we were told the price had changed between the time we booked and when we arrived – which wasn’t true, as the same rates were still showing online. After 30 minutes of going back and forth, management finally agreed to issue a credit, but not for the full amount.

In the end, the credit was never processed.

The pool was really cold and unbearable. Of course, it's dry season, so I should've expected that, but the steps leading into the pool were very slippery. I couldn't work out if it was the finish of the stairs or if it was mould build up. Despite there being a rail, I couldn't help but think how an older person may go getting in and out of the pool.

When we walked into the apartment, there was a very strong mouldy smell. I'm not sure if the apartment above has a water leak, but each time we walked out and came back in the apartment, had the same strong mouldy smell.

The beds were extremely comfortable to sleep in with nice pillows, in saying this I did notice that when lifting the quilt and flat sheet up that there was quite a lot of hair all over the mattress, indicating the sheets were not clean. One bedroom fan was working as it should, and the other bedroom fan was on its way out. It was running very slow with minimal airflow.

The shower gets luke warm and doesn't get hot . I feel like Oaks Darwin has really gone downhill to when I first stayed there not long after it was built.

However Dingo Moon Lodge was easily the worst hostel I have stayed in during my travels.

I was awoken at 3am to find myself being urinated upon by a drunk girl passed out in the bunk above me. Next morning the owner, Jason Hanna, gave me a refund for the night (paid for by the girl) but offered no apology, only 'this happens all the time'.

The girl at reception allowed me to wash my soaked clothes (washing is not allowed between 6am and 2pm) as I was checking out that morning anyway. However I went to my car and when I returned to retrieve my clothes the owner pushed the gate closed in my face and refused me entry! He said I couldn;t enter as I had checked out already and shouldn't be using the washing machine out of hours! I told him he was being unreasonable. He responded 'tough, you're not getting your clothes, go away and come back in an hour or two!'

The owner was the most grotesquely rude, arrogant and vindictive man I've ever had the misfortune to deal with. He isn't fit to run a lemonade stall. He instructs his staff to refuse to extend the stays of those who have been there a while, as they don't book tours! The man is obviously concerned solely with money and not his guests.

I had also pointed out many of the hostel's other failings to the owner, to no effect. He did not apologise for the fact that homeless people get over the fence on a night and sleep in the sunloungers by the pool, wandering around and using the facilites. This is especially concerning as there are NO lockers in which to store your valuables. In fact there aren't even any cupboards or hooks to hang your clothes, so the floor is strewn with your room-mates belongings. Non-residents also come and go as they please throughout the night.

The kitchen is outdoors, and as food is stored exposed on open shelves the place is overrun with cats and possums at night.

The showers are not the dirtiest I've seen but the sinks were blocked, one washing machine was filled with dirty water and the air-con in my 8-bed dorm was broken - the noise prevented adequate sleep on the nights I wasn't being micturated upon. Again, no hint of an apology from the owner.

The WiFi is nonexistent and the free breakfast consists of tea, cereal and crumpets - no milk.

Avoid this place like the plague and go over the road to Crocodilly or one of the other hostels on Mitchell Street.",8 years ago,10-07-2017,-12.4596274,130.8366005,she order my me,-0.973

​Working in the tourism and hospitality industry requires a fundamental appreciation for human contact and a capacity for empathy. The individual we encountered possessed neither. Her behaviour was not just unprofessional; it was deeply unkind. One has to wonder about the kind of life that leads to such a cold and dismissive attitude towards people in need.

The kitchen is so dirty and they never wash and clean the kitchen nor their electrical appliances. They must be stupid to think that anyone could clean or cook in that dirty kitchen. Their family room was $220 with a very dirty and uncomfortable bed. They never do room service. After cleaning the pool, the owner/manager locked it! Not sure for what reason. It’s there for a reason. Also don’t trust the pics you see on google or on the internet. Looks very different .",2 months ago,02-08-2025,-12.4315786,130.8380584,room was the rooms,-0.9687

Don’t be silly like me and not check the reviews before booking! I am honestly not sure how this place is still operating.

Arriving outside it looked grim & dirty, I thought “maybe inside will be better”… it wasn’t. First thing you see In reception is a sign that says “NO REFUNDS”.

Now I’ve stayed in budget accommodation, but for over $100 per night you would expect the place to at least be CLEAN! Dead insects, dust & grime everywhere, all housekeeping must do is change the sheets.

It looks like it hasn’t been renovated since it opened, I think every tile in the room was cracked or chipped. Holes & cracks in the walls, furniture looks like it was found on the street, the mattress feels like you are sleeping on car springs covered by a thin piece of paper.

Last but not least the SMELL… it smelled like an abandoned house that hadn’t been opened since the 1950’s, no amount of deodorant or fresh air could get rid of it.

The helicopter flight over the floodplain gave us all a bird’s-eye view of this breathtaking landscape, and nothing beat the thrill of landing on a remote billabong for some world-class barra fishing.

Back at camp, the combination of a crystal-clear swimming hole framed by red escarpments and the relaxed vibe of the open-air bar created the perfect setting for parents to unwind. The food was a genuine highlight: fresh, flavorful, and served with that warm Outback hospitality you dream of. At night, our family sank into the spacious, safari-style glamping tents, where comfortable beds, and private decks made us forget we were miles from civilization.

After getting over my surprise, I decided to eat here anyway and very glad I did. I ordered a meal and drink and relaxed for an hour or so. The peace and isolation was great. The barman was friendly and ready for a chat. The fish and chips were fresh and quickly served up. Real old-fashioned country service. Thanks guys.

Venue: A beautiful place. Romantic decorating. Cozy but causal setting. Larger outdoor area. Lovely background music. Good atomphere. Clean & tidy. --- 8.2/10
Service: run by Koreans. A ""Call button"" under the table to call for order and service. No tap water provided. Wait persons were polite. The young girl was nicer, smarter and always smiled. Besides washing bowl, ought to give us extra big bowl /plates for shells when we ordered seafood tower. Better introduce more about their menu especially somethings had been changed from menu. As we asked, told to wait 25 minutes for Seafood Tower. --- 7.5/10
Food & Beverage; Menu was old and torn. Mainly western cuisine with some Korean dishes. No wine list was given to us. Doesn't mention the ingredients of Mocktails. Only know the main fruit juice of the mocktails. Beautiful presentation.
- Mocktail, $11@: tried Paloma Fizz (Grapefruit).
- Homemade Iced Tea, $8@: Tried Yuzu Green tea. Good value. Good portion.

- Seafood Tower, $149 for 2pp (-- 7.6/10): Price is slightly high but acceptable. There are 3 tiers. Top tier is 4 pcs of thick Salmon slices, colored in red (?by beetroot juice) served with apple puree on the bed of green salad. Pretty good and yummy. Much better if served tidy.
Middle tier:  4 Baked scallop with cheese, 2 Pan fried Barra steak, 2 deep fried Pepper Calamari. 2 round Fish cakes. Served with ketchup and mayo and the bed of other green salad. We ate the scallop immediately, but the cheese became harder as cooled down. Scallops were small. Barra steaks was normal. Calamari was big pieces and ok, not so pepper.
Bottom tier: 7 sucked oysters (3 oysters were original flavor + 2 different flavors), 7   garlic butter prawns, 1 Spicy Crab, 1Garden Salad with ? dressing (didn't ask, didn't tell what dressing). Oysters were very small but fresh. Prawns weren't de-veined (disappointed for that. Supposed de-vein in a decent restaurant). Good size but Lack of garlic butter flavor. Crab was good in flavor and size. Large portion of salad (lettuce, carrots, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, spinach & onion) ok fresh.

- Cakes: There are a lot of cakes displayed. It says Korean style cakes. We took Earl Grey pound cake, $6, and Chocolate Banana Cake, $8. Look pretty. Reasonable price. We took away cakes only. They didn't use usual fancy cake box for my cakes. Chocolate banana cake is taller and softer than pound cake. It's easier to be deformed/compressed by the  brown small box. It's better using higher container.
- Chocolate banana cake is pretty yummy. Good in texture. Also not too sweet. My cake was deformed slightly before home. --- 8/10
- Earl grey pound cake was a bit dry. Flavor is good. --- 7.3/10",3 years ago,05-10-2022,-12.4512831,130.8219138,outliers,0.9986

I chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday with 17 of my friends. I made the reservation in person, confirmed it again via email and voice call, and everything seemed in order.

However, at the end of the evening, the owner approached me directly at the register and asked if I wasn’t going to pay the entire bill. I explained that each guest would pay for what they ordered — their own food and drinks — and when I paid for my own meal and drinks, I was informed there was a $30 fee for bringing my own birthday cake. I said I would pay it, but also asked why wasn’t I informed earlier?

She replied that it was normal and that all restaurants charge this fee. What she didn’t know is that I have 11 years of experience in the hospitality industry, and I’ve never seen anything like this in my life.

Nobody mentioned this fee during the in-person booking, email confirmation, or phone call.

As the situation unfolded, all my guests stood up and came to the register to pay, forming a line. After the first guest paid, she turned to me and asked, “If someone doesn’t pay, will you cover it?” I looked at her — still in disbelief about what was happening — and said, “Don’t worry, nothing will be missing.”

Thank you, Ana, for giving me the worst customer service experience I’ve had in my 38 years.

On a positive note, I want to sincerely thank the chefs  the food was truly delicious, and many of my guests complimented the flavors and presentation.

Everything was fine until the owner started rudely asking the birthday girl if she was going to cover the bill. She repeated this several times, raising her voice and using very expressive face, saying that if anything was left unpaid, the birthday girl would have to cover it.

At that point, there were still 15 people who hadn’t paid yet, and the birthday girl said it was fine, that she was sure everyone would pay and nothing would be left outstanding. Despite that, the owner repeated herself two more times in a very condescending way, as if she didn’t trust us at all.

In the end, of course, everyone paid and there was nothing left on the bill. So there was no need to talk to us like that. On top of that, the owner charged the birthday girl $30 just because she brought her own cake — even though, it was not mentioned when she made the booking and our total bill was nearly $800.

For comparison, the night before we celebrated at another Greek restaurant, Meraki, and the experience was completely different. The owner personally came to the table to congratulate the birthday girl, happily stored the cake in the fridge at no charge, and kept checking that everything was perfect at the table. That’s what true hospitality looks like.

Unfortunately, despite the food at Yots being good, neither I nor any of the 17 girls will ever return. The service provided by owner Ana was TERRIBLE, and her arrogance ruined what should have been a special night. It feels like a place that only cares about money, not about their customers — and Ana clearly have no idea how to deal with people.

The restaurant is located on the west side of Cullen Bay, right next to the docking area. It was a fairly busy evening, with most of the tables occupied.
I had the Barramundi fish and chips and a beer. The fish was delicious with a mild, buttery flavor and a flaky texture. The dish came with a side salad and a couple of complimentary sauces. The portion was big enough to be filling. Overall, I can definitely recommend the fish and chips. The pizzas also looked good, though I didn’t try them.
As for drinks, I noticed a wide variety of beers, including some locally brewed ones — so if you enjoy trying local treats, it’s a good place to come.
Food and drink orders are placed at the bar but brought to your table. We were told there would be about an hour's wait for the food, but it arrived in around 40 minutes. The staff was friendly and professional.

So my friends and I were here just for a couple of drinks, we arrived at around 9:10pm and still feel hungry, we noticed that the kitchen was closed so we went to the counter to buy some snack for drinks, but the staff said no snacks here.
So we decided to get some snack outside to eat.
Only some chips and cracker.
And then the lady came with a rude attitude to us “ you can not eat food from outside here, it is our policy, if my venue manger see it, I am gonna be in trouble” (seriously? Your venue manager will come and blame you for this? If yes, I want to suggest him/her to extend kitchen operation time please)
Even though we could partially understood for that excuse but she said balabala about the policy, which does not help for our hungry belly. Kitchen closed, no snacks.

She was very rude and upsetting customers here(there was only a few guests though,but it looks crowded in other pub at the same time) , we are Darwin local and we just wanted a good day to share and talk with our friends. But with this “pink hair policy” manager in here, I am pretty sure it is not a good idea. She left us with “ do you understand?” “ that’s it, end of story”

How ridiculous, I feel lucky that I am not working for her, for sure she is not eligible for managing a pub.

PS: I remember the “pink hair” manager said “ if you go to domino, can you bring food and drink in? “
Okay, I just wanna make it clear that domino does not close kitchen during their service time, and also the pink hair must not know that domino also has 100% good food guarantee, which means if you are not happy for the food, you can get a refund. Do you understand that, can you refund my drink for your arrogant customer service, pink hair?  I am not sure it is a good idea for you as a manager to compare this pub to an international company, which does not make sense to us.

It was just a paid day Wednesday night, not even on the weekend, this stupid and arrogant attitude will not help for the business to last long.

Btw: the ginger beer was flat too, focus on your service and quality, otherwise potential guests will turn around, and learn from the best pub, to be better, come on, I am sure your venue manger wants to see more about profit and good comments rather than this type of drama.",2 months ago,16-07-2025,-12.461163,130.838172,she order my me,0.9922

The house is located in a beautiful part of Darwin right on the water in Cullen Bay. It's a short walk around the bay to a wide selection of restaurants and cuisines.

The house consists of 4 pavilions surrounding a 10m unheated pool. The pavilions house two bedrooms (double storey), one bed room (single storey), common lounge/kitchen area and a separate pavilion for dining. Both the kitchen and dining pavilions have nice views of the bay and moored boats.

Each bedroom has its own bathroom, in the open Balinese style. This may be a nice experience for some, but might be bothersome for others who prefer a more enclosed environment.

Every bedroom has air-conditioning as does the dining pavilion. The top bedroom on the double storey pavilion can get ghastly hot, but does cool down reasonably quickly with the aircon.

There is an older flat screen TV in the kitchen/dining pavilion, and a smaller TV in the top floor bedroom.

There are two lovely outdoor seating areas, one undercover off the kitchen pavilion and one exposed near the private jetty.

There are also plenty of nooks and crannies where you can curl up with a good book. The dining pavilion has a pretty bench seat framed by views of the bay.

A laundry is hidden away in the corner with dryer, washer and ironing board.

Overall we really did enjoy ourselves for our week stay.

Just a few observations:
* The house really does need a little refurbishment.
* Particularly all the horizontal surfaces, table tops, benches, bench cushions could do with some rejuvenation.
* We were here at the beginning of the wet season, and if you are mosquito prone, there are a LOT of them. Particularly in the outdoor bathrooms
* There is no WiFi, which is quite surprising in this day and age.
* The TV does need an upgrade to a smart TV to allow guests to stream their own entertainment (assuming there is WiFi)
* Cellular reception is excellent and fast
* If you plan on cooking check there is gas supplied to the cooktop (there is a separate gas BBQ). There did not appear to be any gas during our stay.

no play ground: single swing and it's not under shade, two slides and 1 rope play spot, only enough room for 1 and a half families.

We almost drove straight by the entrance drive, if it wasn’t for Google Maps. The entrance is an adjacent to a large asphalt car park for an Agricultural chemical business, which questions whether you’ve reached the right place or not. The gallery is up a small path, over an earth mound and through some trees, almost impossible to see from the road or car park.

The gallery itself is a collection of dongas and sea containers around an open courtyard. Worlds away from your upmarket galleries in Darwin. The unframed indigenous artworks are contained in cardboard portfolios and horizontal filing cabinets. The didgeridoos stacked up against the wall. A little scary to see everything stored with little respect to protecting them against the elements. The quality, design and authenticity of the artworks however is far better than most/all of the galleries we’d seen in Kakadu.

We were greeted by the most laidback bush territorian, who told us to have a look around and let him know if we were interested in anything. We ended up finding the perfect painting, and felt we didn’t end up paying some extravagant commission.

We had a wonderful time at Hologram Zoo in Darwin! The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring that our children had a great experience throughout our visit. The first stage of this exciting project has been completed, and they're already hard at work on stage two, which is expected to be ready by February.

The zoo offers a unique experience compared to other children's attractions in Darwin. It's also a fantastic venue for big group celebrations, including birthday parties, with plenty of food options will be available soon in February . One of the highlights for us was the Christmas theme, especially the “Flying with Santa” experience—it felt like I was actually riding on Santa's sleigh!

The Photo Booth was another fun feature, allowing you to choose from various themes to take memorable pictures with dinosaurs, jungle animals, and more. It’s an experience the whole family will enjoy—both kids and adults!

What impressed me most was the team's commitment to improvement; they actively sought feedback from visitors on how to make the experience even better.

Overpriced and we are still slightly confused about what we paid $100 for.

My wife and I decided to take our 2 year old son as we thought it would be a nice family activity to do together.
The building itself had a strong stale smell inside, like curry on the stove.
It was staffed by an 8 - 10 year old boy that was directed to give us the 3D glasses, these were smeared with dirty fingerprints you could hardly see through them.
He then proceeded to lead us to multiple curtained booths while mumbling instructions about what we had to do and how many times we had to do laps of the same areas.

We originally went to do the dinosaur experience but you couldn’t buy this on its own, (no wonder) it had to be bundled with a main attraction, in this case the hologram zoo. Turned out the dinosaurs was a one person at a time hologram so the family had to sit and wait while we took turns to stand there and try and work out what was going on.

There is also a free washing machine available, toilets/showers, and a ""plunge"" pool, aka a pool made from an old water tank.
$100 will get you a powered site for 3 nights. Water is bore but filtered, so ok for washing up, etc, but maybe make sure you have drinking water on board. Pets welcome.",4 months ago,26-05-2025,-12.7290073,130.3663071,campground camp toilets showers,0.9287

I am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with my recent experience at Red Rooster.

The older gentleman working at the tills demonstrated behaviour that raises serious concerns regarding hygiene and professionalism. While preparing my food, he was repeatedly touching his face, which is entirely inappropriate for someone handling meals. He appeared to recognise me from a previous visit where I had not been given a receipt, and his attitude seemed noticeably unfriendly.

What followed was completely unacceptable: he went to the back of the premises, visibly adjusted or pulled up his trousers, and upon returning, placed my chicken into the box using his bare hands. This is a clear violation of basic food hygiene standards.

Additionally, I had ordered a vegetarian burger, which was packed together with meat items, resulting in cross-contamination. This is not only careless, but also potentially harmful to individuals with dietary restrictions or allergies.

This experience has left me deeply concerned about the standards of food handling and customer service at this location. I urge management to take immediate action to address these issues and ensure all staff are trained in proper hygiene and food safety protocols.

Until then, I will not be returning and cannot in good conscience recommend this establishment to others.",3 months ago,05-07-2025,-12.396171,130.897109,she order my me,0.6428

Being on a boat that only seats 20 was great as we got so close to the crocs and everyone had a great view, no matter where you sat. Multiple crocs got so close to the boat during their jump that they touched the boat. Its obvious that he has worked with these crocs for years, his passion, knowledge and experience shone through. He knew where to find every croc, how they preferred to catch their prey and how to read their body language.  He knew all their little quirks and it meant we saw heaps of crocs. Despite being in a smaller boat, we never felt unsafe, at times he would stop trying to feed the crocs to gauge their behaviour, making sure that he didn't create competition for food between the crocs we got surrounded by. He also made sure that the weight of the boat was evenly distributed, which meant that the side of the boat not closest to the croc could stand up and get an amazing view. While this did mean sitting next to strangers, after 2 hours you all become mates anyway, this just speeds up the process. Our 2 hour tour ended up going over (which no one had any issues with) to make sure we got to see a large male croc up close. We learnt a-lot not just about the individual crocs on the river but also about crocs in general, their ecosystem on the river and their conservation story.  We also got to see a Sea Eagle as well as multiple Black and Whistling Kites catch their food up close. I cannot recommend this tour more, if you are in Darwin and are toying up between tours, this is THE one to do.

As they were quite negative will write a detailed review of our experience.

Was told it would be 30 mins, waited for food (not delivered) and it was indeed about 30mins.

Store would benefit from facelift & hole in roof being repaired (likely landlord issue not theirs). Waited in shopping centre which was a pleasant space & browsed at other stores windows.

Service from staff was fine for a fast food environment (no different to most), though the customer service could be warmer / chattier from the young chaps (Rinaldo was lovely).

Can only speak for their pizza. We had gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza, base was lovely, lots of toppings, chicken was beautiful & fell apart. Not at all oily, or burnt (as others mentioned), was crispy and well cooked, good amount of cheese.

Meatlovers / supreme (not gf) was also really good. Oilier than gf bbq chicken, but probably due to having more meats like ham / bacon on it. Definitely not too oily though, crispy, lots of toppings, well cooked and very tasty.

Sizing could be a bit confusing for some. I'm from Adelaide, so their mini is our small, their small what I consider medium, their medium is my large and their large, my family. With that in mind prices seem more reasonable & worth it for the amount of toppings and quality.

Would definitely recommend them to others. Give them a try for yourself, our experience didnt match others reviews. Yum 9/10 pizza 🍕 photo only shows half as half was already eaten 😋",a year ago,23-06-2024,-12.3777556,130.8960849,outliers,0.9958

The soft shell crab was okay. The legs were good but as you keep eating to the main body, you can taste a really fishy smell that not even the dipping sauce could cover.

The Peking duck three way was amazing. The pancakes were warm, the duck meat was good (though the skin could be crispier) and the sauce was amazing. The duck soup is really nice to drink. The duck fried rice is what you would expect of a normal fried rice.

The kinto pork spare ribs is the star of the dish for me. The ribs were fried to perfection and the sweet tomato sauce goes so well with it. Would definitely recommend this.

The spicy salt squid is the star of the dish for my partner. I loved it too. I'm glad it had a slight kick to it as I couldn't see much chilli on it and thought it was going to be a plain salt and pepper squid dish.

Food:
Our meal at Nando’s Casuarina was absolutely fantastic! We ordered chilly broccoli, serious large peri-peri chips, garlic bread, pitta bread with hummus, and a full extra-extra spicy chicken—and everything was perfect.

Chilly Broccoli had a great smoky, slightly charred flavor with just the right amount of spice, making it a delicious and healthy addition to our meal.

Serious Large Peri-Peri Chips were crispy, golden, and packed with that signature peri-peri seasoning—every bite was full of bold flavor.

Garlic Bread was soft, buttery, and had a rich garlic kick that paired beautifully with the meal.

Pitta Bread with Hummus was fresh and warm, and the hummus was creamy and well-balanced with a smooth, nutty taste.

Full Extra-Extra Spicy Chicken was the star of the meal! Cooked to perfection, juicy on the inside, with that fiery heat we were craving. If you love spice, this is a must-try!

Service:
The staff were friendly, fast, and attentive. They made sure everything was spot on and served our food quickly despite the busy atmosphere. It’s always great to see such a well-managed team ensuring a top-notch dining experience.

Atmosphere:
The restaurant had a lively and welcoming vibe. It was clean, well-organized, and had a comfortable setting to sit and enjoy a meal. The background music added to the experience without being too loud.

Overall Experience:
This was a perfect Nando’s experience—flavorful food, excellent service, and a great atmosphere. Everything was fresh, tasty, and cooked just right.

While the bar is not the most well stocked, you should be able to find something to drink as they have some wine, beers, spirits, and mixers.

I'm sad to say that their food has not been very good the two times I've eaten there.

They have a wonderful wood-fired pizza oven but they overload their pizza with cheese and it's so heavy you can't pick up a slice without it sliding off and therefore, the base is undercooked in the middle.

I've ordered tapas there also.  Woefully under-seasoned, and some items on their menu are not as described. For example, tempura battered cauliflower, is actually crumbed cauliflower, which was cold on the inside, and the crumb was warm - served with 3 generous sized pieces with no dipping sauce or dressing at all.  Their croquettes were also crumbed, and the béchamcel sauce was very loose, so they didn't hold their structure and collapsed once the fork touched it (also 3 generous sized pieces per serve - also needed something to season it). Their meatballs in red sauce, what can I say .... the sauce was warmer than the meatballs, and it also needed seasoning.

Overall, I will stick to the chips and hope they are hot, crispy, and tasty.",3 months ago,30-06-2025,-12.4340611,130.8444528,outliers,0.3577

Just a heads-up—don’t rely on the photos of the menu or cooked meals, as they’re no longer available during the week.

I used to love coming here after dropping my kids at daycare—grabbing a coffee, enjoying a proper breakfast, and getting some work done a few times a week. Unfortunately, that’s changed.

When I mentioned my disappointment about the lack of cooked food and that I might have to find another spot, the response I got was, “Oh, we’ll see you later then”—with a bit of attitude.

I’ll probably hold off on coming back until they offer more than just sandwiches. I love a good cooked breakfast, and if I wanted a sandwich, I’d just make one at home.

If the limited menu is due to staffing issues, that’s understandable—but a little communication would go a long way.

Ah sure, we gave the place a lash, didn’t we? Thought it’d be grand — and parts of it were, to be fair — but Jaysus, the rice was a sad affair. Soggy as a wet sock left out in the Galway rain. Like, did they cook it or drown it for sport?

Now in fairness, the spice saved the day. Lovely bit of heat — not the kind that punches you in the face, more like a slow burn that gives you a nudge and a wink. Tasted like someone in that kitchen knows what they’re at, at least with flavour.

And the lettuce? Would you believe it — class altogether. Fresh, crunchy, bit of a snap to it. You’d nearly write home about it, like. Probably the happiest leaf I’ve eaten in weeks.

The goat curry was fantastic, not too spicy, not too mild, and tasted just like a homemade one. The jeera rice, on the other hand, was just plain basmati rice. It could have been better. Overall, I had a decent dining experience at this restaurant.",2 years ago,26-07-2023,-12.3795258,130.8489361,curry kofta tikka butter,0.9842

To make matters worse, my husband actually vomited after eating just one pani puri. It was that bad. This is totally unacceptable and raises serious concerns about hygiene and food safety.

The concreted path is about 10min walk one way, wheelchair and pram friendly (the bridge entrance is quite steep). It is connected to the resort as well. However, there is no direct parking to this area that connects to the concreted path! The only feasible way for wheelchair is to stop on the road side near the bridge (there is not even road shoulder to safely pull over). The resort entrance has steps and only accessible to hotel guests.

This newly concreted path is along the rapid creek river, local children technically swim in this area but there can be crocs plus the creek is contaminated with PFAS.
The trail is very easy and flat.

The trail continues with the bushwalking woodland area for another 2km one way. Gravel/dirt/mud not wheelchair friendly but an easy track to walk.

Can see many native birds here, best to do it in the morning, or at night if you want to see nocturnal birds.

Bring hats, sunscreen, sunnies, mosquito repellent.

Even then, it was a fascinating experience — a school reaching children scattered across the vast Australian Outback through the airwaves. The concept of providing education over such long distances was impressive and deeply memorable.

Fast forward to today, and much has changed. The school has embraced modern technology, and all lessons are now delivered online. Through specially developed digital platforms, students can join live classes, interact with their teachers, and access educational resources, all in real time — no matter how remote their location may be.

The visitor experience is compact but very well designed. In a short but engaging tour, you learn how the school operates. The exhibition area includes short documentary videos, interactive displays, and historical artifacts that trace the evolution of distance education in Australia. One of the highlights is the opportunity to observe a live class in session. Through large viewing windows, visitors can see teachers conducting their virtual lessons, offering a unique glimpse into this unconventional classroom environment.

What struck me most was the passion and dedication of the staff. Teaching children who may live hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away requires not only technical skills but also creativity, adaptability, and empathy.

The School of the Air in Alice Springs is much more than just a school. It's a pioneering institution that has evolved with the times while staying true to its mission: making education accessible, no matter the distance.

Visited on 10/7/2019

The compound housed the Alice Springs Old Gaol and the Women's Museum of Australia. The entry fee is for both the ""attractions"".

Since Australia was a former British colony, the word ""gaol"" was used instead of jail, or prison.

Upon entry to the converted residential building is the souvenir shop and sales counter staffed by volunteers. There are some interesting items on sale including local­ly made and designed jew­ellery, acces­sories, home­wares, chil­dren’s gifts, sou­venirs and a range of books on extra­or­di­nary women.

The shop also offers unique, most­ly hand made prod­ucts made by prisoners at the Alice Springs Cor­rec­tion­al Centre, such as metal decorative artwork, aboriginal boomerang, etc.

The gaol was opened in 1938 and oper­at­ed until 1996. It was gen­der segre­gat­ed until the mid-1980’s before becom­ing male only due to over­crowd­ing.

In 1998, the North­ern Ter­ri­to­ry Gov­ern­ment demol­ished all the non-heritage list­ed build­ings on the site. That explains why there are not many cells around to accommodate all the gaolers.

The Women's Cell Block is a long building made of cement bricks. The women doing time here could not be that aggressive or violent, becuse there were beds in the verandah where they slept during very hot days.

It is interesting to read the information posters on the wall outside some cells.

Talka Willian was the matron between 1956 and 1984. She was well liked, and treated the women kindly. From my research, Telka Williams was the Angel of Redemption at the women’s gaol, the saviour of special needs people in Central Australia. The women cooked on benches tiled themselves, in colourful uniforms they designed and sewed, in cells they painted, as they slept on beds adorned with their own hand made quilts.

The men's block is quite different. Many of the inscription, collages and paintings are by inmates can still be seen. Some of the cell doors are locked, but visitors can peep through a small glass-plate opening on the door to view the interior.",4 years ago,31-07-2021,-23.7040998,133.8766218,alice springs in the,0.8422

Some of the carvings and paintings on the walls of the cells have been preserved. They range from the depressing, where prisoners were counting the numbers of days they were locked in, to the inspiring, with incredible paintings.

If you have kids, ask at the front desk for a activity sheet, which leads them through the cells and also provides clues to find different things themselves.

There was no-one else inside and the glass entry door was covered in greasy handprints. The two young female staff members who served us obviously didn’t want to be there and weren’t polite at all. One girl was using her phone on same the counter where the sub gets made and the other girl was carelessly throwing bits of paper over her shoulder in the bin. Zero care for customer service at all.

It was only after we had ordered that we looked around more and started regretting our decision. All the front windows were dirty just like the door. There was drink and food residue spilled all over the bin. The place looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in months. The vegetables looked bad, very limp and not at all fresh.

While waiting, I read a Google Maps review about how someone felt sick after eating there. But by this time our subs were ready so we felt committed to the order. On the way home I looked at more bad reviews and by time we got home we had both completely lost our appetite and didn’t touch the subs — they were both chicken subs so we didn’t want to risk getting sick either.

It is disability friendly and let us sit where my son felt comfortable  the menu was chicken cashew (yummy flavoured and cook to perfection,), , jasmine rice was in high demand my son had two bowls. Record for him. Roti not that good it was rubbery and chicken noodle taste good but  dev rejected it as not noodle the reason the noodles were small pieces . Well the chef has mentioned  he can cook as demanded and next visit he will try and make noodle where dev would say yes. Hope I can find a restaurant who could do this.

45 minutes of no further replies and 2 unanswered calls later, I get a call back and was told I did not answer my door. I have been sitting 5 feet from my front door in my living room since making the order.

When I asked what would be done, she still only repeated herself, then said she did not have a driver for the rest of the day. I then asked for a refund and she said the food could be delivered tomorrow morning. When I did not accept this, she said she could not provide a refund but her manager would call me back.

This is not the first time. I suggest the company get some staff in who actually are aware giving someone raw chicken can make them very sick!

————————————————————
Thank you for your below copy and pasted response. I have filled out the form via the link. It’s now been two weeks. And for the general public- I still have not heard from management or an area manger re food safety . Had I not eaten half way through my meal and not realised if could have made me very sick!  Now my question is. What are you serving to children with uneducated staff serving raw chicken as seen above in Protoss I’ve attached. Is not acceptable no excuse.

But the lack of response from an area manger /or manager is blatantly obvious your lack of caring and commitment to your town the service and Quality your producing. With McDonald’s across the road and kfc you wonder why this place is dead and takes 30mjns to get served at McDonalds they’re that BUSY why wouldn’t A chicken store like red rooster wouldn’t want to have some of that business as well they don’t care simple

Marvellous job done
Staff were nice and friendly.  KfC don't stress Ur crew for beating the time. Let food served as it comes.

23 January: food was good. Boneless chicken came little cold vut my son ate all the pieces he likes.  Boneless chicken is not same as melbiurne , they have ling strip with lots of coating but here they and coating and chicken shape of nuggets. But the boys did the good job, he gave the pieces with lots of coating. My son love the costing. He ate all the 6 chicken nuggets as he like

25 january
Good work guys. The front counter team were awesome and the best thing I found was that the packer was listening to the cashier and filling the box as asked. They also gave the Boneless chicken as coating and he said we don't have long strip one. We order the feast meal and for once the 18 piece which was given was distributed evenly . Theyvhad breast and the chicken part which has meat with burns, drumsticks. Omg the original feed was so much thatv4 adults couldn't finish them. Thevpacking of chicken was nice and each piece tasted yummy. The nuggets the best one so far, just cook right. It wasn't overcook with brown coating. This one was yellowish soft chicken and as we  could taste the chicken and juice. The kids enjoyed their nuggets. Potatoes gravey and colsew all fresh

This is our favourite restaurant now as this crew made our day and since we both are fusy eaters they accommodated their needs. The manager were nice too, needed some help and request she was at the front in few minutes.  So I came here at the restaurant at 9pm.  So this evening team you had has been trained well and it seems the production line and serving lines were working together. The cook in the kitchen knows what they were doing. Kfc taste good when it is on between cooked. Don't like when coating is dark brown as chicken get rubbery. Attach is the picks of 25th janaury 2024.

Is this the best McDonald’s in Australia?  We think it is.  We do a lot of travelling and have visited many McDonald’s stores - nothing compares.  We were supposed to be just passing through Alice Springs but instead we stayed for more than a week.  This was all due to the awesome welcoming, friendly and efficient service we received at McDonald’s Alice Springs together with the delicious, hot fresh food and smooth, creamy, aromatic coffee that we thoroughly enjoyed - the best coffee we’ve ever had anywhere.  Kathleen, the People Performance Manager, is just amazing.  She always happily greeted us and other customers upon entering the store.  And what a difference that makes.  Kathleen and the entire crew should be congratulated on their efforts. The Store Manager was also really nice.  Honestly, we couldn’t keep away from the place.  We love this McDonald’s store.  They all work really hard - a fast paced very busy store without compromise.  It is no wonder they are so so busy - everything is just perfect.  It’s all go go go and they have such a methodical team system happening - it’s very impressive.  And we’ve never seen a McDonald’s ‘drive through’ queued to this lengthy extent.  Now that says it all.  It’s certainly an indication of how good this store is.  OMG this is unbelievable.  Impeccable service, great tasting food, flavoursome coffee.  But there’s more.  Squeaky clean store throughout with tables/chairs, floor and toilets all immaculate. The crew even treated us to some unexpected fine table service. What more could you ask for?  We have to say that they made us feel very special at McDonald’s Alice Springs and although we are from Victoria, we just cannot wait to return to this particular store.  Our thanks go out to the entire crew.  May you all be commended and rewarded for your enthusiasm and pleasantries in giving customers just that little bit extra - we really appreciate it.

I'm not sure if management has changed but staff are good and some changes are still in progress.
The original menu items are still available, but added now is Indian fusion food, including popular street food and to the ice-cream range is kulfi, and some other Indian desert choices. And as mentions the combo of Indian and Mexican food like the Indian burrito bowl.

We also got the offer to change 1 of the Hake in Seafood Meal into Barramundi just for an additional A$5. As I was dining inside the store on arvo Sunday 28th of July 2024, I saw the orders taken care of effectively, no long waits, even with only 2 staffs.

The atmosphere was adequate. For in-store dining, the oil steams were immediately taken out by the exhaust. You can still catch a little of the steam, though. It’s better to eat in the afresco area when the weather is good.

Unfortunately the food was not to my liking. To be courteous, I don’t think it fits my Balinese tongue as I don’t like excessive oil on my meals. I think it’s more because of Australian taste instead of Balinese. We weren’t asked whether we want our fish crumbed with flour or not. Even so, the fishes were well cooked so I can eat them without the breading. You can also ask for extra tartare or alioli for A$1 each. I also happen to get only 1 seafood stick instead of 2 in the Seafood Meal. Pretty average place, for me.

In short, this place is just an ordinary place. If you want gourmet fish, this is not the place. But remember that you can cook by yourself, like for the schnitzel and chips. Then, it’d be cheaper and it will taste the same. Maybe you will end up dining here, except when you have read this review properly.",a year ago,28-07-2024,-23.6998288,133.8810373,outliers,0.9334

Had two kids birthdays this weekend, both family members.
One birthday at Gillen Club - 8 kids and 13 adults and one at Club Eastside - 12 kids and 10 adults.
Gillen Club we had 6 platters - 2 x meat, 2 x pizza, 1 x fruit and 1 x sliders, just over $500
Club Eastside, we had 8 platters - 2 x meat, 2 x sandwiches, 2 x fruit, 1 x antipasto and 1 x vegan, all up approx $1100.  Add on jugs of soda as well as the takeaway containers.

Sandwiches - egg, ham and salami. $135.
All smothered in some sort of chutney or relish and not one kid ate a salami sandwich.  Who the heck gives out that many salami sandwiches at a kids birthday.

Meat platters - Couldn't find any buffalo wings, unless nibbles are what they classify them as, both had about $10 worth chips (and that's a stretch), 4 Mince pies, nuggets, a few tenders, 4 quiche and 6 saus rolls.  Was this worth $140 - hardly!!

Fruit platter - decorated ok, very thinly sliced, seem like one quarter of the three melon varieties were used.  Could they not afford more than 2 oranges.  For $135 per platter, I'm sure they could.

Antipasto $135 and Vegan $125.  Each had 3 x cherry tomatoes cut in half and the food did not even cover the board.  What a joke!!
The only abundant things on offer were the sauces.

The quantity on the platters, seriously did not justify the cost and I guarantee that it did not feed 10 people, well maybe the sandwiches would have if most werent salami and each one smothered in chutney.
If would have been cheaper if we had just ordered food off the menu.  Would have been well under $1k and everyone would have been fed.

It seems that Gillen Club provides value for money and decent size platter portions.
Club Eastside not as good as it once was for the platter servings compared to a couple of years ago and I recommend that people discuss the platter options with staff to know exactly what you'll be getting

Word of advice, if ordering the sandwich platter, be sure to advise them of what fillings you would like.  I wish I had done so.

Either this is so cheap and that's why it's a pitt, or this place is a palace and I'm lying but you can't win on both. You mentioned that we spent 4 days there so you also know we booked at your dump given that I hadn't mention that detail. If other people are OK to live in unclean places, each to their own.

Advised he’s only recently taken back over after a long journey with previous management and he, his father and the rest of the team doing a power of work to get things up to speed.

Facilities were a little run down but as I said they are truly pushing out the work to get it up and going. One of the best showers I’ve had I. 7 weeks!!!.

The team dog sat out two dogs Juni and Marley for portions of 3 days and with plenty of kennels out back I’m sure would be more than willing to do so for others.  This is how the business was originally built on dog friendly principles.

Dogs wash was great again needs tweaking to fully get back up and running and with a great free time area for the dogs I can’t talk more highly of this place if you have dogs.

Time will be the making of it and given they have only had it back for a few weeks it should be a great park once again.

Thanks again and look forward to returning in the future.

We booked based on what we saw online, without having checked it out first. The plus side in our opinion, is that the campsite is attached to the pub, which may not suit everyone. We liked the pub and had a great meal there. In the summer it would be great with the outside area and the pools. It was too cold for us this time unfortunately. This would encourage us to at least stop in again in the summer.
As for the campground, this was a basic unsheltered mostly patch of dirt. The unpowered sites were cheap so we weren't too fussed about the looks of the place. Unfortunately there was no handy camp kitchen. The BBQ areas only had cold water for dishes and you had to pay to use the BBQS. We hadn't seen that at a paid site before. We usually expect at least a free camp kitchen. We did put our money in on one night to do steaks but it turned off well before our food was cooked and we ended up cooking in our van in the end. A waste of money and effort! We don't even like our steaks cooked for long! As for the toilets and showers. It looks at though they were installed within the last few years and that was probably the last clean they had. This area was depressing and filthy. I noticed cleaning equipment sitting outside the block a few times but maybe they were put there by staff who were pretending to management that they had cleaned. When we arrived I had a look into the cubicles and they were horrendous! Every day I had another look to check if things had been cleaned and NO. Before we left, I was so used to seeing this sight that I could describe the mess in detail and was 100% sure nothing had been cleaned. So in general, it was a dirty and depressing place to stay with the only real benefit being the close proximity of the pub. Also, the security gates around the campsite never seemed to be locked at night and we had one of our camping neighbours shooing people away from going through people's things by their vehicles. NOT really safe either!! We're on the road a LOT and this is one of the worst campsites we've come across unfortunately.",2 months ago,14-07-2025,-23.7217119,133.8694017,campground camp toilets showers,-0.9625

My family had no alternative but to order elsewhere, so it became a VERY expensive and disappointing meal after a difficult day which was meant to be an easy night.

Pizza was 4 hours late!! Yes, 4 hours, ordered at 7.15pm and delivered finally at 11.14pm.

Over 14 calls with the store after 2 hours, spoke to the Indian Manager, Cooinda (Unsure of spelling) on 2 occasions 1 hours apart, and he outright lied to us both times.

Offered us half price back and was going to put them in the oven and deliver immediately himself. Outright lie, on a call in another HOUR, his young employee admitted our order was not yet cooked.
Food arrived after 11 pm by young women who had been called in to support overdue deliveries. They were very much put on the spot and we felt sorry for them having to face multiple very unhappy customers.

Food was undercooked, dough was raw and UNSAFE for human consumption, we had to try to cook it ourselves to make it edible.

Food was incomplete, missing drinks and sides ordered.

Manager refused to speak to me after lying to me, confirmed by his young lovely staff (confirmed that indeed the order had NOT been cooked as promised an hour earlier when already 3 hours late).

No disrespect to the staff who are obviously working for an incompetent manager who lies and then leaves young inexperienced staff to face the music of upset and angry customers. We do not blame any of them at all.

Please Pizza hut either get a decent manager on board and work this out or don't offer delivery, this is the THIRD time of orders not received and store not answering over the last year but in a small town with limited options we decided to try again.

This will be the LAST time for our family or businesses to order from you.

Extremely disappointing and downright dangerous serving undercooked and unsafe food to people.

Also, never received the partial refund we were promised, even the dog couldn't eat this, we request a full refund.

Recommendations:
*3 x food drops
*filter your water at each trail head
*don’t use camelbak type water bladders as your only water storage
*share your load around a group
*is the Helinox chair really worth the weight?
*Strive food (Tasmanian Dehydrated Trail food manufacturer) is A+ grade food that tastes delicious
*plan to sleep at the top of mountain tops instead of the trail heads. Trust me you’ll want those sunsets and sunsets. This will mean some short or  some long days. Plan well.
*get your dry pack weight down as low as your budget allows
*I wore a LS Sun hoodie shirt, 5.11 trousers and Salomon boots but admitted you could get away very sturdy high quality trail shoes and lighter clothing (w/ sun screen and insect repellent then more needed)
*a pair of high gaiters are only needed in a section or 2 at most. The track was cut back by workers in most sections when I walked it.
*no the 2 cafes along the way can not be relied upon to resupply and of the typical ‘through hikers’ gear/food needs.
*high water and electrolytes intake. I routinely carried 5L at the start of a trail head (sleep on a mountain, hike the next day to a trail head for water resupply, carry on.
*I was forced into the water on the trail in the Thorntons Gap area for water crossing. It was a high rainfall year this year it looked and there’s no way around it. Oh and the water is like ice!

He was very engaged and fun to listen to.

The views all the way along the gorges were breathtaking.  The occasional sighting of a freshie (freshwater crocodile) resting on the bank or on a rock added to the experience.

This was hands down the worst attitude I’ve ever encountered in any restaurant — anywhere in all my life.

My wife was blatantly disrespected twice by a staff member named Edna. The first time was simply for sitting at a table that was ""apparently"" for staff but not marked as such, second time for asking if someone could clean a table as they were all dirty with food markings on the tables — a basic, reasonable request. Edna responded with an aggressive tone, a hostile attitude, and a stare that made my wife feel incredibly uncomfortable — as if she had no right to even ask.

We had already paid for our food, but because of Edna’s repeated disrespect, we decided to cancel our order and requested a refund — which we were given.

To be clear, we had originally returned to Red Rooster because of a fantastic experience with a young woman named Leeta earlier in the day. She was warm, kind, and welcoming — a true asset to your team. But Edna’s behavior completely erased that goodwill.

When I calmly asked Edna why she had spoken to my wife that way, her only reply was, “That’s how I speak to everyone.”

To the owner or manager: If that’s the standard your staff are allowed to uphold, you won’t see returning customers. A business is only as good as the people representing it at the front. Right now, that representation is a problem due to Edna.",4 months ago,04-06-2025,-14.4640676,132.2621176,she order my me,0.9241

Wow – just wow! One of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had.

We started with the calamari fritti, which simply melted in our mouths and set the tone for an incredible night. For mains, my wife had the pork belly – absolutely mind-blowing, rich, tender, and perfectly paired with a five-spice fruity sauce. I went with the 350g scotch fillet, cooked to absolute perfection. Both dishes were outstanding.

Even though we were full, we couldn’t resist dessert – and I’m glad we didn’t! I had the Golden Plate award-winning passionfruit curd tart (a true standout) while my wife enjoyed the indulgent chocolate fondant. Both were unforgettable.

The cocktails topped it all off beautifully, the service was spot on, and the atmosphere was just perfect.

This time, we booked to stay at Contour specifically so we could try the restaurant. I booked the restaurant online and received a confirmation and was asked to confirm a few days prior to arrival.

Upon arrival, no booking in the system 🤦‍♀️. We were able to be accommodated inside because it was very quiet.

We ordered the pork belly and the fish curry.  At $42 and $44 you have expectations and these dishes did not come close to meeting them.  The meals were so bad we are thinking the reviews must be fake haha.

The pork belly with soy sauce was so salty it was inedible.  The feedback from the kitchen after they tried it - agreed.

The fish curry lacked appeal in presentation. The three prawns were small and most likely from a frozen packet (I’ve bought exact same from Woolies) and the barramundi although a decent size was thick. Not light and easy to slice a fork through. The sauce although tasty had the general smell of off milk.

I don’t know if the chef is on holiday or they have had a change of staff, but the meals were so disappointing , it doesn’t match with what we have read.

The flies are also very bad inside, you are constantly shooing them away.

One of us is now currently incapacitated in the bathroom (the pork meal) and I have stomach cramps so hopefully I don’t have to update this review with food poisoning.

Firstly I had to wait in reception for quite awhile - this was around 4pm. There was a staff member on their computer in a room to the left in reception but they didn’t acknowledge me or say someone was coming to assist.

We booked based on the rave reviews of the restaurant. Unfortunate timing for us as there was a wedding taking place the following day and two coach loads of older individuals. We couldn’t get near the restaurant :(. We had to order from literally the only Indian restaurant that would deliver in Katherine. And that was average btw.

The location is just out of town. Which made us feel ‘safer’ and it is gated. Large manicured grounds, very tidy and nice trees/lawn. A lot bigger than we expected, there are multiple options for accommodation inc caravans with ensuite cabins.

Motel style - park in front of your room. We stayed in a deluxe room. This is not deluxe at all, very dated. It hasn’t been updated since the 80’s. It was passable clean. Our neighbors tried to open their back sliding door and it fell off 🤦‍♀️😅 I wouldn’t expect to pay more than $150 a night - $235 was very overpriced.

Everyone — from the ladies at the front to the waiters — was super friendly, helpful, and genuinely kind. It really made us feel at home.

The lunchtime specials were outstanding — fantastic value for money with massive portions that left us more than satisfied. The food was delicious and clearly made with care.

I asked could I see before committing, the manager happily agreed to me even trying with the van before taking my money. Much appreciated too.

I got the van in, so all was good. She even gave me a 7 day discount, even though they normally don't. Saved a few $$$

Great park, great management, very friendly and helpful. Sites are angled for easy exit, and concrete for van and vehicle, and awning, can't ask for better.

The location is fantastic—right in the gorge area, with walking access to a beautiful lookout and the starting point for the boat tours. The visitor centre is large and well-maintained, serving good food and offering decent Wi-Fi.

However, the powered sites are quite cramped—just enough room to park the camper and squeeze in a table and chairs. It’s a bit disappointing to be in the vast outback and still hear your neighbour flushing the toilet.

The same Assoc that runs the Nitmiluk Gorge Cruises & associated activities in such a professional, safe & seamless manner. The Beagle should be the Motel of choice for anyone who has experienced Nitmiluk. But sadly, it doesn't match that standard.
We had a ""Superior Queen"" room, which stated it's a comfortable room for two people. We paid over $200 for this.
What was delivered was a room nowhere near Superior.
For two people there was;
1 glass
1 bedside table
1 chair
No bedside lamps
No towel rails or even hooks in the bathroom.
The small electric jug leaked water over the bench.

The lino floor had holes in it. The venetian blind didn't shut properly. The curtains over it were see through (see photos) The light outside was on all night, so our room was bright. Sleep was difficult. And I did not undress or dress in the room as anyone walking past could see into the room. A huge gap under the door welcomed in the bugs.
The area behind the front door, which can't be seen when it's open, was filthy.
The experience was very unpleasant.

I've read the reviews & I'm not the only one pointing out issues. The Management responds with phrases like ""We will keep this in mind for future improvements""
""Genuinely sorry your stay did not meet your expectations""
""Not a standard we aim to uphold""

Please Jawoyn Assoc, a few hundred dollars can fix a lot of these problems. It's not an expensive fix to add hooks in the bathroom, another side table, another chair, drinking water glasses, table lamps.

Not only did the housekeeper knock on my door and wake me up at 8:30am, despite check-out being at 10am, but she also came back around 9:30am, knocked once and immediately opened the door while I was still in bed. That’s incredibly disrespectful and intrusive.

On top of that, it’s simply impossible to sleep in the morning: there’s a jigsaw saw being used right next to the rooms, and some people gather outside the bedrooms, laughing and speaking loudly, as if no guests were trying to rest.

I did notice some improvements, such as the installation of a smart TV, new outdoor furniture, and better bedding, which shows that some effort has been made. But unfortunately, these positives were overshadowed by the lack of respect for guests’ comfort.

The food, especially given the remote setting, is excellent. Portions are generously sized, so you definitely get good value for your money. The menu offers a surprising variety, from grilled steaks and prawn linguine to modern Australian dishes and even themed nights like Asian or Italian, all prepared with fresh ingredients.

For Tennant Creek, it’s uncommon to find such quality and portion sizes at moderate prices, and Sporties delivers consistently. The atmosphere is laid-back and welcoming, perfect for a relaxed dinner with friends or family.

That said, there is a bit of a trade-off. On occasion, you might notice some domestic issues or raised voices just outside the premises. While it doesn’t happen often and doesn’t generally spill into the dining space, it can be a distraction during quieter moments.

After nine days in Tennant Creek, we want to give a special shout-out to Kylie and the team at the Tennant Creek Caravan Park. Kylie was absolutely fantastic—always friendly, smiling, and genuinely helpful. She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed, and her effort didn’t go unnoticed.

The pool was a real highlight—perfect for cooling off in the afternoons, always clean and refreshing. There’s a cleaner who comes through daily, keeping the amenities fresh, which made a big difference during our extended stay. Yes, its a little dated, but this is an outback town with limited resources, if you want a 5* hotel, stay on the Gold cost for ten times the price.

It’s easy to overlook places like this when you’re just passing through, but we’re grateful for the comfort, care, and kindness we experienced here. We’d happily stay again and highly recommend it to anyone coming through Tennant Creek.

The town gets alot of negative press, but for the 9 nights we stayed here, I went running everyday, everywhere, and no one bothered me. We didn't see anyone jumping the fence or steeling (we took our things inside at night) theres a little noise out in the street but that can't be helped. Just ask to stay away from the road.

There is a small car park area, fenced to protect the wildlife and environment.

Clearly posted is the walkway down onto the beach. You can dip your toes in the water as you stroll along, but swimming is not recommended. This is due to crocodiles and box jellyfish.
The scenery is calming and peaceful.
A wonderful beach to take your children to play on the sand or simply sit and watch a sunset.

Beautiful location, great and fun drive in along the dunes and beaches (need a 4WD), limited number of people (you need a permit for camping or day use).

Explore a variety of the beaches; Oyster Beach, Cave Beach (these are a right turn, campground is a left turn up the small peninsula) and those you drive along to access the campsites.

All of the campsites are large and secluded from each other (3 and 4 are the closest together, you can see the other campsite). We stayed at Campsite 4 and loved the view.

We were told that Campsite 3 was the penthouse with the best views (it is next to Campsite 4, on the corner with views over both beaches), but Campsite 4 goes right down to the beach (Campsite 3 is consistently higher up); we would choose Campsite 4 again in the future.

There are wooden poles across the front of the campsites, on Campsite 4 we were able to drive our Prado in-between two poles; this allowed us to put up our shade for the few days we camped here, and gave us privacy from Campsite 3.

This is an incredible spot! The views are phenomenal. Camp for a few days and relax, walk along the beaches, fish, explore the 4WD tracks, swim in the shallows (the water is so clear). Such a beautiful place.

Please spare the time to collect some rubbish on your trip, due to the wind the beaches collect a lot of rubbish, the rangers work hard to clean up, but the little we can do will help.",2 years ago,26-06-2023,-12.1611093,136.780389,4wd camping beach campsite,0.9888

On Sunday, 6th July 2025, I dined at your establishment and was overcharged by $80. Unfortunately, this overcharge went unnoticed until the following day. Upon realising the error, I phoned the tavern and spoke with an employee, who assured me they would follow up. However, I did not receive a return call.

I then visited the tavern in person and spoke to the manager, who stated they could not assist me at that time but took my bank account details and assured me that the matter would be rectified as soon as the accounts team were in the following day. Despite this reassurance, I have yet to receive a reimbursement.

Since then, I have made three additional phone calls, each time being told that the manager would return my call — a promise that has not been fulfilled. I am now home from my holiday and still out of pocket by $80, with no resolution in sight.

Do not underestimate the toll the Kakadu heat & humidity will do to you even for a short distance. 2 options - take either the unsealed, uneven incline walk with steps to get to the first rock shelter with ancient & recent aboriginal artwork or take the flat paved route to the lower & main rock art area.

An over 80s male in our group did not heed the advice & had a near collapse up at the 1st rock shelter. Timely first aid by guide & attendees revived him but overall set us back by half an hour. We then had to curtail the rest of tour stops to make up time. So please know your limits. Do give this ancient significant place the time it deserves & do the longer signposted walks if you are fit & able.✨️",2 months ago,02-08-2025,-12.8655241,132.814001,rock walk cave aboriginal,0.8631

Often when you’re spending a larger sum of money on a things like this, you can feel worried that it might not end up being worth it, but let me tell you that this tour was 100% worth it.
Sean had so much knowledge that he shared with us throughout the day and it was really special to be shown the traditional ways of food gathering & cooking etc by Patsy.

Patsy is a real Aboriginal woman who somehow manages to bring you closer to the culture of a fascinating people. Don is super enthusiastic and passionate about his job, and throughout the whole trip he never stopped sharing really interesting info.
During the tour, we got to try out some unique flavors and scents from the land—digging up shellfish, tasting edible berries, smelling the strong aroma of green ants (and even trying their surprisingly delicate flavor). We also spotted a few animals along the way—buffalo, dingoes, and lots of amazing birds.
When we arrived at this little slice of paradise in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by thousands of birds, a traditional fire was set up. We cooked what we had collected plus some meat (buffalo and birds) brought along for the occasion. Don even baked damper, a kind of traditional bread.
I highly recommend this experience. I’m sure you’ll find other similar tours, but I honestly doubt you’ll meet someone like Don, who puts such incredible passion into his work.

The Skipper cum guide was excellent (did not get his name, sorry!) - gently swinging the boat around, so both sides got a turn to view the billabong's star attractions. Midway, he switched off the engines & allowed us to listen to the sounds of saltmarsh which was contemplative & tranquil. He was amusing, knowledgeable & imparted enough info without overwhelming.

Apart from the Crocs, the birdlife is numerous. Watch the cutesy flitting of the pink crested Jacana & his little ones on the lilly pads, blue kingfisher darting in & out of the water, Darters drying their wings, tons of whistling ducks, elegant Jabirus, multitude of herons & some birds of prey flying overhead. Feral brumbies & introduced species also call this home & cannot be totally eradicated unfortunately.

Just wished that I could stay longer to do both the sunrise & sunset cruise. There's plenty of cold water onboard to keep hydrated - stiflingly hot & humid.

We made occasional stops to look at trees and animals, but for us, most of this was already familiar. The boat has no speakers, so the cruise was mostly silent. This quiet time could easily be filled with what the tour lacked—more cultural sharing.

I tried not to leave negative comments even when I don’t like the food. As I think it’s unfair to judge when everyone has individually different tastes. But I feel I have to put this one here so no more vegan people would have similar experience as I had tonight.

$42 roasted eggplant is not worth it.
I was excited about the $42 eggplant would be exceptional but…
Mine was too salty and overcooked.
Eggplant literally tasted like salt with the burnt eggplant charcoal covered. The sauces around it made the dish looked expensive but it was very difficult to taste anything good when the eggplant was that salty.

I told one of the staff that the eggplant is too salty and burnt. But she said it’s normal colour when it’s grilled. Ok, either her eggplant is always burnt or I misunderstood the $42 doesn’t mean high standards? She should argue with customers after she actually tasted it herself so she was not prejudging my experience, or customer’s’ experience. She said she will let the chef know.

I don’t know if I care or not chef does or doesn’t know the eggplant is overcooked and over-salted. But I came here to spend $42 to learn that maybe I should’ve never attempted to spend $42 for roasted eggplant! Hopefully my sacrifice will save someone else’s money and a peaceful night.

Suggestions:
Go to the shop and get Mi goreng instant noodles with a can of chickpeas. Put chickpeas together with the noodles and it tastes alright if you have hungry vegan stomach. It’ve got your proteins as well! 😉

P.S. if you read till this bit and not a vegan, I cannot tell you what their other food is like. Sorry!

Buffet-style breakfasts are served between 6:30 and 10:00 am - generally no need to book but I would suggest that you time your breakfast to avoid when all the tourists are finishing their Yellow River cruise as it gets very busy. There was a reasonable selection of cereals, toast, fruits, pastries and full hot breakfast with bacon, poached and scrambled eggs, baked beans, and hash browns etc. I loved the juice machines - nothing like freshly squeezed orange juice or if you want coffee, they have a great Nespresso machine for guests to use.

We were both impressed by Mimi's restaurant, it certainly wasn't what we expected and if you want to sample Australian bushfoods in delicious dishes then it is a perfect introduction to the uninitiated.",2 months ago,29-07-2025,-12.9058,132.5214097,dinner food was the,0.992

Well no 1 is probably the smallest site I’ve ever seen and it was dirt and leaves - the map is not in proportion. So that was annoying.  It’s also right on the bend of the road. Had a little bit of shade which was something.  Camp is quiet.

Camp kitchen is very close to site 1 - as well as the amenities block and laundry. Laundry is $4 a load.  Buy the detergent from onsite shop or bring your own. They do have clotheslines if you have pegs or clothes horses chained to the outside verandah.  There is another huge camp kitchen opposite the laundry.

The Amenities - there are two blocks so plenty of showers and toilets if you don’t go at peak hour. They are reasonably surface clean.  Some of the shower heads are terrible and need replacing.

The pools are very nice. There is a main pool including kiddies pool - with shade and grass and a second pool next to restaurant that is a bit quieter.

The Barra Bar does a good pizza! Extremely fast service.

The onsite shop has a very good range of non perishable goods.

Nightly at 1830 there is a huge waft of sewage, there is a sewage point 50m away so try to avoid this site and go as far away as possible :(

The whole set up is great, there are a lot of accommodation and food options. Staff are friendly and helpful and the grounds are well kept.

We booked the Yellow Water River Cruise from here - it was a well organized tour - I did a separate review.

Highly Recommend. Do your research if you are using the campground to select the site that best suits your set up. We would definitely return.",a year ago,02-07-2024,-12.9050481,132.5216561,campground camp toilets showers,0.9763

🌄 Uluru – Where the Earth Speaks in Stories
Standing before Uluru (Ayers Rock), my husband and I were absolutely in awe — not just by its sheer size or its striking red glow at sunset, but by the deep, spiritual presence it holds. 💫
This UNESCO World Heritage site isn’t just a rock — it's a sacred site for the Anangu people, rich with ancient stories passed down through generations. Stories that teach, inspire, and guide — serving as role models for those yet to come.
💬 Every crevice, every color shift tells a tale.
And let’s be honest... photos don’t do it justice — you feel Uluru more than you see it.

I’ll start with the positives, from our driver/story teller Michael, to the didgeridoo player, the staff, the sunset, canapés were absolutely outstanding. And even though I’m not much of a wine drinker from all reports that was great too.
Unfortunately, not long after being seated, and the sun started to set the wind and cold was hard to deal with, even taking jackets and using the blankets provided. The heaters were not effective at all due to the high wind, our entrees and mains were cold, even though they were bought to the table with a cloche.
Basically unacceptable for a $80 pub feed let alone a $900 per couple. I understand you can’t control the weather but you can control your dining area. The addition of a closed section or even a more effective wind break would’ve made the night enjoyable.

Gallery staff are really helpful and enthusiastic about the art being created in front of visitors like us, and on this occasion, Adelaide was the gallery assistant who explained the creation stories of Uluru and the Anangu indigenous artists.   Adelaide was a pleasure to deal with, and made our purchase of another artwork really easy, as well as, packing the large canvas securely in a postal tube for air transit back home on our flight and delivering it to our accommodation.    And, it arrived safely in over-sized baggage thanks to her diligence with the packing.

Walkatjara is a not for profit Art Centre owned by the Aboriginal Mutitjulu community.   This gave us confidence and comfort with our purchases and was a reason we went back to this gallery.   You have the opportunity to ask questions and receive insights about the artwork in the place where the artwork was created, as well as, knowing that you are supporting the local indigenous community in this iconic Australian location.

If visiting, take the opportunity to look through the many canvases that are displayed or on tables.

I highly do not recommend Outback Sky Journeys. This was the only letdown on an otherwise incredible trip to Uluru.

The experience was extremely underwhelming. We were taken to an area just behind the car park in the resort, where passing headlights from vehicles kept flashing directly into our eyes, completely ruining any attempt at proper stargazing. The guide insisted we not use our phones, yet the spot was so poorly chosen and light-polluted that we could barely see anything meaningful in the sky.

The telescope looked outdated, and the objects shown were the same ones clearly visible to the naked eye. No planets, no nebulas, no Milky Way arches — nothing that couldn’t be identified using a free sky app.

The guide mostly pointed at stars and recited basic facts — nothing insightful, and certainly not worth the premium price charged for this experience.

Honestly, it felt like a waste of money and time. For something that’s supposed to be magical and awe-inspiring under Uluru’s skies, this was poorly executed and disappointing from start to finish.",2 months ago,29-07-2025,-25.2413442,130.9834636,uluru the experience of,-0.8812

You have several packages to choose from with the cheapest being an 8-minute tour, a 15 minute tour and a 25-30 minute tour. The middle package is typically the most popular because it's not much more expensive than the shortest tour and provides the most satisfying experience overall. Note that each tour time includes the flight time to and from the helipad, but this does not detract from the experience because the taking off and landing while seeing the perspective of where you are from the air in general on its own is a lot of fun as well.

Anyway, I did the 15-minute Kings Canyon flight and this gives you two passes over the canyon itself and two passes over the surrounding area which allows people on both sides of the helicopter have the opportunity to take good photos/videos of everything.

One of the very cool aspects of the flight was that we would do a hard banking turn to flip around so the other side could get photos, and the G-forces associated with that were amazing, plus seeing the horizon flip 70-90 degrees!

For Uluru/Kata Tjuta, we did the 25 minute flight. Again, multiple passes for everyone and a nice hard banking at 180-200km/h for good measure. We also got a good overview of the Ayers Rock Resort and surrounding area.

Throughout the entire experience, the pilot explained everything that was happening, we could hear the calls to the tower so we could understand what the communication process in general was there, we could talk to each other and the pilot (you are muted when the pilot is talking to the tower), and at all times the ride was smooth with no unexpected bumps. We felt completely safe the entire time. Even the landing was A-1 without a single bump - you couldn't feel it!

Booking was effortless, the safety induction was simple and painless, and the crew take care of all aspects of securing you in the helicopter with respect to belting up and so forth.

The entire experience was worth every dollar. I highly recommend it.",4 months ago,18-05-2025,-25.2413108,130.98337,uluru the experience of,0.9963

Secondly: between Laverton in the west and Yulara in the east, there are no mechanics and very limited places to buy tyres. Don’t count on buying a tyre out here. Make sure you travel with 2 x spare tyres.

The Great Central Road is located on the WA side of the border, the Northern Territory side is called Tjukaruru Road.

Language / translation note:
“Tjukaruru” means straight.

History:
Prior to the construction of the Great Central Road, there was a walking track that linked Laverton, WA to the vast interior of WA. This unnamed track was used for thousands of years prior to Laverton being built. It was a walking track between tribal territories that was inspersed with rockholes that held small quantities of water. The next iteration of the Great Central Road was “Laverton to Warburton Mission Track” which carried supplies from Laverton to Warburton Mission from 1934-late 1960s. This track mirrored the ancient traditional walking track and to this day, many of the rockholes that supplied water to tribal people can still be found quite close to the modern Great Central Road. In this section, modern history has run parallel with the ancient past.

The Great Central Road was altered in the 1990s and early 2000s to remove some of the blind corners and improve safety somewhat, but on average it still retains much of the original and ancient walking track shape.

To clarify an earlier detail: supplies were trucked out from Laverton in the Mission times and once the Mission disbanded, fuel and grocery supplies were then bought in from Welshpool, WA or Alice Springs depending on which communities were receiving goods along the Great Central Road.

Until 1957, Warburton Mission Road (the precursor to the Great Central Road) only extended from Laverton to Warburton, no additional roads went east from there.

From the late 1950s, the first road originating from the east was constructed and a connecting section of this road connected Warburton and onto the East and West, it is called the Gunbarrel Highway.
The point at which the Gunbarrel diverted south through to Warburton Mission was -and is still- called Jackie Junction.

The Gunbarrel Highway only coincidentally crosses occasional sections of what is now the Great Central Road.They were constructed for entirely different purposes, with the Great Central Road being intended to carry people between communities and the Gunbarrel Highway being intended to recover “Test” rockets fired from Woomera, in South Australia as part of the “Blue Streak Rocket Program”, which was a precursor to modern intercontinental ballistic missiles.

In the 1970s and 1980s travel between Warburton and Giles (Warakurna) was becoming more common and the Gunbarrel Highway was not intended to directly connect the two communities, it went miles out of the way and wasted much fuel winding around the desert. So a new and more direct path was proposed and built by the Yarnangu (the tribal people of this region). They used a small tractor, picks, axes and shovels and constructed a new and more direct route across the Gibson Desert from Warburton to what is now Warakurna but was then known as Giles.
This was the almost final section of what is now the Great Central Road.
The road from Kata Tjuṯa to Kaltjukatjarra was already constructed but a small section of road between Warakurna (Giles), WA and Kaltjukatjarra (Docker River), NT needed to be formally connected and that became what is now the Great Central Road connecting WA to the NT via an inland direct highway, allowing easy navigation for tourists and supply trucks, compared to the previous indirect routes.",a year ago,13-05-2024,-25.3036864,130.7010627,uluru the experience of,0.9974

We ate at the outback kiosk and had good food both times. Pizza was good and the chicken tender meal was huge. A little bit dearer than at home but that is to be expected and you don't mind paying when the food is actually good.

The gift shop had a nice range of souvenirs and snacks/ice cream/essentials etc.

I wanted to give 5 stars but the last day our room didn't get serviced, I rang at 3pm and asked if they knew if it would be done that day and the girl said they would do it between 3pm-5pm as they do new arrivals rooms until 3pm. No one came and I asked at the front desk after 5pm, the girl said the housekeeping people had finished for the day.

I was walking home from school, I decided to go to the store and buy chips (my mom gave me money for lunch at school, but I'm smart and decided to spend the money on chips). After I bought the chips, I went home, but on the way home I saw a white van from which an uncle in a black coat got out, he came up to me and asked,
-Would you like some candy. And I told him
- Of course! What fool would refuse candy.
He gave me a candy, and also offered to take me home. I got into his van, and we drove. When I wanted to tell him where I lived, he said: Shut up! I don't know what I did to make him so angry, but I decided to keep quiet anyway.
We drove for a very long time, but it was good that I bought chips with my mom's money, so I wasn't hungry. When we arrived it got very hot, he opened the car and threw me out. Well, I didn't get lost and ran after him. But his car was very fast and I couldn't catch up with him. Overall, I liked the trip. There were only two minuses.
