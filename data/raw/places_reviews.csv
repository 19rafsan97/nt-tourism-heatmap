ChIJs-U2BPgPvywRckfb8tiyWNk,Buley Rockhole (car park),Darwin_Palmerston,Helen Nguyen,5,"Buley Rockhole offers a quiet, calming contrast to the nearby Florence Falls — perfect for a more relaxed dip either before or after visiting the main plunge pool. It’s conveniently located on the same route, making it a great stopover.

The stream gently flows downhill, forming a series of cascading rock pools connected like natural steps. You can relax in any of them, though the lower pools tend to be more popular. The water is deep in parts, which makes it ideal for floating with a pool noodle or even jumping in from the rock ledges.

It’s a peaceful spot to unwind, soak in the beauty of nature, and enjoy the cool, clear waters in a more low-key setting. A wonderful stop in Litchfield that feels both refreshing and serene.",2 months ago,06-08-2025,-13.1118587,130.7876454
ChIJs-U2BPgPvywRckfb8tiyWNk,Buley Rockhole (car park),Darwin_Palmerston,200 and a Van,5,One of my favourite spots on our 12000km trip. Beautiful swimming holes. Don’t expect privacy if a tour group arrives or personal space. It disappoints me the way groups can take over a space with little regard to others. A reminder too that it is a NO SMOKING area. It is a magical spot and a must do! Super easy walk from carpark.,a month ago,15-08-2025,-13.1118587,130.7876454

ChIJs-U2BPgPvywRckfb8tiyWNk,Buley Rockhole (car park),Darwin_Palmerston,Jennifer Ryder,4,"Gorgeous spot for a cool off on a hot day. The main pool is deep enough to jump into from the edge. Water is so refreshing and clear. As a mature woman with not so flexible knees these days, I did find it difficult to enter and exit the pools without assistance. There are no rails to hold onto, and I doubt it would be a worthwhile exercise installing rails to enter and exit the pools. It's an easy walk from the carpark to the pools. Just be mindful that it's a rocky walk. Not accessible for wheelchairs.",3 months ago,27-06-2025,-13.1118587,130.7876454
ChIJs-U2BPgPvywRckfb8tiyWNk,Buley Rockhole (car park),Darwin_Palmerston,Louise Tome,5,Buley rockhole is a series of rock pools that cascade down the river. It is a hidden oasis from the heat just a short walk from the carpark and picnic area. Access can be a bit tricky as there is no man-made entry to the water so care needs to be taken both entering and leaving the water in each rockpool. We swam at the beginning of the dry season so the water was still flowing and deep in some pools. The water level is seasonal and in the dry the rock pools can become isolated and stagnant not safe for swimming.,2 months ago,09-07-2025,-13.1118587,130.7876454

No tickets needed. Entry is totally free! This war memorial park is such a peaceful spot with a beautiful sea view. It’s perfect if you’re looking for a relaxing walk, a jog, or just a quiet place to watch the sunset.

One thing that really impressed me was the Polar Sundial. It actually showed the exact time when I took the picture of it, so cool! The park also has lots of info panels that give you a glimpse into Darwin’s wartime history, which makes it both calming and educational.

It seems to be open all the time—there’s no gate or closing hours, which is super convenient. It's definitely a great spot for anyone who loves history or just wants to enjoy nature by the sea.",3 months ago,05-07-2025,-12.4667278,130.8400494

ChIJN4Y2sgmRwCwRUFuZ9rWHoSM,Paul Arnold Gallery,Darwin_Palmerston,Stuart Porteous,5,"I called in spontaneously having been aware of Paul's work over the decades that I've been passing through Darwin. Three things struck me: Firstly,  I was delighted and inspired when he strode through the staff access door with his huge hat and equally huge grin. What struck me specifically was, for all his outer success and obvious promotion and impact on Darwin and the Territory's image nationally and internationally, that he was so present, unpretentious,  modest and genuinely interested in discussing the work and relating the stories associated with each work...

Secondly, when then going onto his internet site, the integrity and congruence between the man, his vocation and his authentic and articulate communication of his inspiration.

Lastly...his assemblage of 'The Territory' Akubras (please correct me if I'm wrong) in the window. A soulfully rugged poetic and enduring symbol of a well-marketed yet gratefully real and talented Territory artisan.

Moving now from the Crocodile Islands and Groote Eylandt to Tasmania there's a Paul Arnold work scheduled to be a part of my Tasmanian home to quintessentially capture the heart and spirit of the Territory.

Congratulations Paul and thanks for the exquisite beauty you bring to the world not only through your art but who and how you are in the world.",6 years ago,02-06-2019,-12.464319,130.8427365

ChIJWfUCiYKRwCwREvK_ugWYvVU,George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens,Darwin_Palmerston,The Melbie,4,"A mouthful of a name for Darwin's Botanic gardens but George Brown is the very reason it is still in a good state after Cyclone Tracey of 1974. Did a guided walk with Walk Darwin & according to guide John, this was not the only cyclone to wreak damage in the gardens.

It is expansive, so you will get an excellent workout as it is set on a hilly slope - find a layout map if you want to get through it all.

Notable section is the Madagascar & African garden with massive Baob trees incl the local native Adansonia Gregorii.

Waterfall has not worked for quite awhile & it is evident parts of the garden is neglected. Interesting tropical trees like Ashoka Seraca (religious significance to Buddhists), toxic Suicide Tree (Cerberus Odallam) - up there with Death Cap mushies 🫣, Pride of Burma Amhertsia, Black Bean Moreton chestnut tree, Sausage Tree (er.. rr..true - from Africa) & quite few others used in perfumes, medicinal oils or just plain quirky.

Main entrance is actually across the road from Mindil Sunset Beach area - look for Eva's Cafe on google which is just past  entrance. Interesting sculptures scattered around, some good & others like the dinosaurs in the cycad area plain garish (cast off from elsewhere). The Centre is worth a visit for background & seed saving history. We spotted a Rufuos Owl & you will see & hear the ubiquitous native scrubfowls.

I dismissed this as a bit odd and proceeded to enter the cubicle and noticed there was a free condom dispenser and a hole in the wall of the cubicle (seriously), where the other guy was standing. Anyway, I left the cubicle (the guy was still standing in the same place). In addition, there was a guy circling the car park (plenty of parking available). This was all mid-morning!

ChIJC-4DkD8JvywR14m-sJ1A4IY,Florence Falls Waterhole,Darwin_Palmerston,Helen Nguyen,5,"A stunning spot for a swim and easily one of my favourite attractions in Litchfield National Park.

There are two access options: a steep staircase of around 130 steps or a longer, stair-free path that’s more accessible. We visited around midday on a Tuesday — it was fairly busy, but still plenty of space to enjoy the water.

The twin waterfalls aren’t immediately visible from the viewing area, but once you’re in the pool, they reveal themselves beautifully. The swim to the falls is short and manageable — unlike Wangi or Edith Falls, which require a longer swim. I’d highly recommend bringing a pool noodle (a Territory essential!) as the water is deep and it makes floating much more relaxing.

Sitting beneath the falls with water cascading over you was incredibly refreshing. For the adventurous, there are rock ledges nearby to climb and jump from. There’s also a calm, shallow creek off to the side for a more laid-back experience.

I attended the 7pm mass and every week was different—it was interesting to have bishops presiding! As a visiting military person on deployment, Bishop Eugene gave me his blessing and told me this was my home while I was away (having been an Army Chaplain himself), that was a powerful message and definitely one that I needed.

The first mass I attended, I got introduced to the Aboriginal Our Father and it was different but another beautiful form of the same prayer. I didn't hear it the 2nd and 3rd time, so it has become a treasured memory.

At the end of mass, they ask the church goers to help close the doors—there are over 50! It reminds me of the churches in the Philippines, open on all sides for people to come in from all directions.

ChIJ4-_wK9GTwCwRgvgA_-qSUYY,Parap Village Markets,Darwin_Palmerston,Happy Diane,5,"Parap Market is one of my favourites in Darwin. It’s open every Saturday from 8 am to 2 pm, all year round; but it’s especially lovely during the dry season. The weather in July is absolutely delicious; cool in the morning with clear skies, which makes it the perfect setting to enjoy a bowl of laksa or something fresh while walking around.

There’s a great mix of stalls offering food from all over Southeast Asia, fresh produce, handmade goods, flowers, and local art. My absolute go to is the Popia; the spring rolls here are the best!! I also always get the Vietnamese pork skewers and paw paw salad—so yummy:) The smoothie and juice stalls are beautiful too; perfect for something cool and refreshing when it's starting to warm up.

It does get busy, but parking is usually okay if you arrive early or don’t mind walking a little. Dogs aren’t allowed in the market area, which is a shame if you’re bringing your pup along—but good to know ahead of time.

I don’t have many photos from my visits here; which says a lot because I usually take heaps—but I’m too busy living my best life eating all the food 😆

Highly recommend checking it out if you're in Darwin. I love it!",2 months ago,30-07-2025,-12.4316104,130.8446143

You can stand-off to the side and feed them or go down the ramp and stand in a few inches of water.

ChIJq2T1GR2RwCwRvFy8Pd06NaU,RFDS Darwin Tourist Facility,Darwin_Palmerston,The Melbie,5,"A premier Darwin highlight that is equally informative, engrossing & educational. Recounts not only the origins of the crucial medical & allied health services Australia's Flying Doctors Services provide to the remote & inaccessible outback regions but also the WW2 Bombing of Darwin from a different perspective.

After half day tour of Darwin's WW2 bombarment the day prior, I should have been fatigued by overload of info on this subject matter but not! The VR & holographic presentations are brief & totally ""eye witness"" immersive experience not to be missed.

Excellent & moving tribute to essential services RFDS provides to health & mental well-being of remote communities. The origin of this service by Rev. John Flynn & others who contributed is illuminating as is the association with Quensland & NT Aerial Services (Qantas). The VR that showcases this section is in 2 parts: one takes you soaring over the red centre of this continent with pilot's narrative.  2nd: you are in the plane in an emergency situation with a real patient (not confronting). A sensory appreciation for the services & skills of highly trained nurse & navigating pilot. Explore the interior of an actual RFDS plane.

Facilty staff are very welcoming & helpful with suggestions on how best to utilise your 1.5 to 2 hours here.

A free courtesy shuttle bus operates to pick up & drop off in front of facilty from 11.30 am onwards every 15 mins (check the post outside for times & locations).  Operates only from upper areas to this lower Wharf facility which is quite an uphill climb to return.  Was almost 2km walk from my hotel middle of Esplanade to get down here but an eye pleasing cliff edge scenic walk heading towards Darwin Waterfront via Skybridge.

Got here just after 9.00 am opening y'day Sun 27/7/25.  Much quieter! Avoid VR strap on after a sweaty walk - fogs up the lenses ☺️. Courtesy wipes & sanitisers provided for before & after use. Excellent gift shop here.

ChIJaeeLWwSRwCwRkGhSVk0dbsU,Survivors Lookout,Darwin_Palmerston,The Melbie,5,"On 19 Feb 1942, the Survivors of the Japanese aircraft bombarbment of Harbour & Australia's defence port of Darwin gathered here (up on top of steep escarpment) witnessing the devastation below.

The same Japanese commander who led the attack on Pearl Harbour twice launched the first two raids on Darwin. It stopped at two for Pearl Harbour but Darwin was bombarded for a total of 64 times until Nov 1943 with hundreds of casualties & massive annihilation... Little known historical facts to most Australians, me included until this first revelatory visit to Darwin. Bit ashamed really, Darwin's history has flown under radar & for some reason until fairly recently, did not make into school curriculum. Even Kidman is supposed to have professed that until the movie ""Australia"" with scenes of Darwin's aerial raids - she was not aware of Darwin's bombardment in WW2 Pacific's war.

Easy walk to get here from middle of Esplanade - 15 mins at leisurely pace. Past Legislative Assembly of NT on left - note this building's uppermost support structure & four sides are in shape of the bomb tails. Past regal government house on edge of cliff on right with stone & inset copper plaque detailing the fateful day of attack. Keep walking past the massive fig trees obscuring views & you will get to this covered, fairly large Lookout with info boards. Views to harbour is somewhat obscured by cliff face vegetation but still very good. Walk past Survivors Lookout to stairs or lift down to Skybridge & Darwin Waterfront. Worth a stop & perhaps do the self guided walk as signed.

ChIJJdmcJKyRwCwRjd9-a66FC3Q,Wildman Fishing Tours,Darwin_Palmerston,Simon,1,"An expensive and disappointing experience.

We booked a day fishing for our family of 5 for $1950. 6pm the night before we were told we would not be picked up and must drive 1.5hrs to the boat ramp.

After I reversed the charter boat into to water and parked the trailer at the request of the operator....We spent 5-6 hours fishing between 8am until 3pm. My family was not provided with any substantial food over this time, although I was under the impression it would be provided. Only 1 bag or Doritos and 1 bag of lollies. To be fair there were cold drinks available which was nice.

We caught one fish which was great!

The operator spent a good portion of the day dealing with his business affairs on the phone, or with his colleagues on the other larger boat that was present.

The operator was also telling me about his disagreements with other tour operators and swearing about/at them in front of our children. The boat was quite dirty from the fishing charter that had been operated the day before and there was no shade on board.

At the end of the day we gave the other employees (from the larger boat) a lift back to the boat ramp on our charter boat and we even had to turn back for 20 minutes when one of them forgot his phone! Overall it didn't feel like a very special experience for the money, the company hadn't put any effort into making it an enjoyable experience for my family and I would not recommend Wildman Fishing Tours.

ChIJJYbiVIaRwCwRW5ScPzfKtrU,Travellers Walk,Darwin_Palmerston,The Melbie,3,"Got dropped off here by free shuttle bus from Stokes's Hill Wharf (in front of RFDS facilty). Helpful driver said it will be the shortest walk up to Cavenagh St above where I was meeting friends for lunch. Yup - it was was short - kind of, for the fitter person 😉😉. Lot more steps to get up to upper Esplanade/Harry Chen Street & then a right turn into Cavenagh.

This used to be the main walking route up the escarpment from the Wharf area to the township for newly arrived by sea in the early days. Heaving up over rough hewn steps constructed by by early Chinese labour who knew how to work with this type of rockface.

You will pass the heritage Roadmaster's house which is otherwise hidden from view. Do love unexpected heritage encounters like this. Should spruce this up - It is a significant heritage..✨️✨️",2 months ago,04-08-2025,-12.465391,130.84737

ChIJJYbiVIaRwCwRW5ScPzfKtrU,Travellers Walk,Darwin_Palmerston,Andrew 黄延祺 Huang,4,"From the information board at the bottom of the steps:

""Prior to the Stuart Highway upgrade during World War II, visitors to Darwin usually arrived by ship.

""From at least as early as the 1880s, passengers disembarked at the Port of Darwin and climbed the escarpment via the walkway to town known colloquially as Chinamans' or Travellers' Walk.

""The path began at the entrance to the railway yards with steps up to Cavenagh Street and finished at the Terminus Hotel. There, shaded by the great banyan tree, ironically dubbed the Tree of Knowledge, drinkers sat debating the issues of the day. This was the seaward end of Chinatown and the commercial centre of the town, now the site of the Darwin Civic Centre.

""The name of the walkway came about, in part, because Chinese stonemasons, skilled at working with porcellanite, constructed the original pathway and steps. The name was also in recognition of the many people who used it. In the nineteenth century many Chinese. prospectors came north from goldfields elsewhere in Australia and from southern China. Until 1911, there were more Chinese than Europeans in the Top End of the Territory and they made up a vital part of the economy and character of the town.

""Photographic evidence shows that the path zigzagged its way up the hill. The route has changed over more than a century of use and has been, at different times, wider, fenced and eventually concreted.""",10 months ago,11-11-2024,-12.465391,130.84737

The real feature of this hotel is the top notch breakfast, which had an enormous selection of food including a robot pancake machine. With food in Australia being so pricey the included breakfast was a huge bonus.

If I were to brave the fearsome humidity of Darwin I would absolutely choose this hotel again.

The biggest disappointment was my Chanel Coco perfume went missing from the bathroom while a Do Not Disturb sign was on the door during the day while on a tour.

They have joined the herd by adding a fee for using a credit card, which I think should be the cost of doing business for a hotel. I've heard all the arguments and didn't find them compelling.

ChIJt4AwD0TrwCwRArdj30fj_Yc,Club Tropical Resort Darwin,Darwin_Palmerston,Blake,1,"I have stayed in over half of all the accommodation options in Darwin, this is the worst so far!

SAFETY:
1. Staying with a group, myself and others were given master keys (without asking). They opened every room in the place. BEWARE that total strangers have keys to your room.
2. The pool has no lighting. Trying to supervise kids past dark is very difficult and dangerous, since you can't see anyone. (See photo)
3. The place is overall very dark. It feels unfinished. I'd feel unsafe here if I was a solo traveller.

VALUE:
Extremely poor value. Go stay at Darwin resort for at least 1/2 the price for better service. They lie to you and say that continental breakfast is included, and then come to charge you after your whole group has eaten ($16 / person for cereal and a couple low quality options and instant coffee).

They even charge for laundry, and even though there's a tap-to-pay sign, it only takes coins.

Even though it is relatively new, the whole place is falling apart. Cracked paint, cheap veneer doors peeling apart, etc.

I was here for almost a week, my bedsheets were never changed. The bathroom was never cleaned. Some days I didn't even get fresh towels.

Also you need a car if you're staying out this far. Door Dash won't even deliver because it's out of town.

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
I could go on an on about the issues during my stay, and all of them were somehow twisted to be blamed on myself and our group. I asked repeatedly to speak with a manager for days, and never got to.

They have a ""no refund"" policy, even if they give you rooms without working aircon or key cards. Pitiful for the price they're charging.

The positives:
The rooms are big and the pools are nice in the daytime.

ChIJVe_keAORwCwRfMlOD0Jfc2Y,Adina Apartment Hotel Darwin Waterfront,Darwin_Palmerston,amit gurbuxani,1,"Hidden charges, rude manager, and zero support — never again.

Adina charged us unfairly and left us with a toddler sleeping in the lobby.

30the September update :
Thank you for your written response. However, I must strongly disagree with the version of events presented. At no point were we advised that staying past 1:00pm would result in being charged at double the hourly late check-out rate. What was communicated to us was simply $30 per hour after 11:00am, which we accepted verbally. The extra $60 charge was applied unilaterally, without our consent or even being informed at the time — only discovered on our invoice. The amount isn’t even the issue, it’s the lack of communication and the attitude of the duty manager.

Further, your response does not acknowledge the real inconvenience we faced as parents of a toddler. My wife vacated the room prior to 1:00pm, and our 18-month-old child had to be put to sleep in the lobby while we sorted things out. This was extremely uncomfortable and stressful, yet no assistance or empathy was offered by your team.

We understand and respect standard hotel policies and check-out procedures. What we are disappointed by is the lack of clear communication, the rigid approach taken despite the circumstances, and the absence of basic courtesy that one expects in the service industry.

We sincerely hope Senior management will reflect on this feedback and take it as an opportunity to improve both transparency and guest care going forward.",in the last week,30-09-2025,-12.4663543,130.8470458

From start to finish, the experience was seamless, convenient, and just what we needed for a special day with family and friends.

The air-conditioned function room was spacious, clean, and beautifully lit with natural light, which made it super comfortable for both kids and adults (especially in Darwin’s heat!). The location is ideal, easy for guests to get to, with plenty of parking and a relaxed, tropical vibe as soon as you enter the resort.

We had external vendors come in to set up soft play and decorations, and the team at FreeSpirit was so flexible and accommodating—nothing was too hard, and they really helped take the stress out of the day. Every staff member we spoke to was friendly, professional, and genuinely supportive. You can tell they care about their guests having a great experience.

The food was delicious and came out exactly on time—hot, fresh, and with generous portions. We had so many compliments from our guests!

Whether you’re hosting a birthday, baby shower, or any type of event, I can’t recommend Darwin FreeSpirit Resort enough. The atmosphere is chilled but polished, and it’s a place where you can truly enjoy the moment while the team takes care of the rest.

The minimum that you ask is respect - the security man in the entrance kindly asked for my ID, why would she allow herself to push me? With no reason at all? Couldn’t she ask: you need to wait and get a stamp to enter tonight? Why did she have to push me? I told this to someone that looks like a manager. I’ve seen him on the club before. He said: “sorry” but the offence does not go away with a “sorry”. Completely disappointed. If you “have to go” take a trip to the raw-nasty-disrespectful entrance on the dry season.

The store is well-organized, making it easy to find everything you need, from fresh produce to pantry staples and household essentials. The shelves are well-stocked, and I rarely struggle to find what I'm looking for.

One of the standout features of this location is the ample parking space. There’s plenty of room, so you don’t have to waste time looking for a spot, even during busy hours. This makes shopping much more convenient, especially for families or those with larger grocery hauls.

The shopping center also offers more than just groceries. The food court is a great place to grab a quick bite, with a variety of options to choose from. Whether you want a snack or a full meal after shopping, there’s something for everyone. Another highlight is the kids' play area, which is perfect for families with young children. It’s a thoughtful addition that makes shopping trips more enjoyable for parents and kids alike.

We had such a wonderful experience dining at Eat A Pizza! From the moment we walked in, the service was incredibly fast and attentive… a rare gem these days. The food was absolutely fantastic, fresh, full of flavour, and genuinely felt like we’d been transported to a little trattoria in Italy.

One thing we really loved, they leave the Parmesan shaker right on the table! No need to ask (which is perfect for someone like me (I love cheese haha) It’s the little things like that that make the experience feel so authentic and relaxed.

We arrived quite late (sorry, we’d just flown back from Bali and were still in holiday mode, craving one last great meal!), but the owner was incredibly welcoming and kind. She came over straight away, made us feel completely at ease, and reassured us to take our time enjoying our food. That genuine hospitality really stood out.

The fact that it’s BYO is another great bonus!!

I witnessed two of the female staff rolling their eyes and side eyeing customers multiple times when being asked simple questions by customers even the one taking orders on the headset. My poor mom decided last minute that she wanted egg in her salad (after already paying) which I was more than happy to pay for and the male staff said ‘How am I going to charge you for that??? Just for egg??’ As if I was supposed to know what he should do… I will have to charge you a 6inch sub’. I wouldn’t know but wouldn’t it have been possible to charge for a few cookies to make up for it? It was such a simple request but he made it a big deal.

I was polite and said thank you over and over hoping it would turn their mood around but idk why I bothered honestly.

I highly recommend their Garlic Naan—it's handmade and has the perfect balance of a crispy exterior and a soft, chewy interior. The garlic flavor is incredibly aromatic and rich, making it a delightful treat. For those who enjoy bolder flavors, pairing it with a curry for dipping is a must!

Personally, I’m a big fan of the Butter Chicken. The curry is rich and creamy, bursting with coconut flavor, and you can choose your spice level to suit your taste. Whether you pair it with rice or Naan, it’s absolutely delicious!",a month ago,03-09-2025,-12.4630498,130.8393969

ChIJPxNXwAiRwCwRJP1FF6fWIgk,Chakoro Sushi,Darwin_Palmerston,edwin gonzales,5,"Nestled in the bustling streets, there lies a culinary treasure that might just be the city's best-kept secret – a quaint sushi place that may be modest in size but is colossal in flavor. This sushi spot is a haven for those who cherish the delicate balance of sushi rice paired with the freshest ingredients.

The California roll and  prawn tempura sushi roll I had the pleasure of tasting were nothing short of perfection. Each roll was crafted with precision, ensuring that every bite was a harmonious blend of flavors. The sushi rice was seasoned impeccably, complementing the succulence of the prawn tempura and the creamy texture of the avocado in the California roll.

Despite its compact size, the store is ingeniously designed to welcome a steady flow of sushi enthusiasts. It's a place where the focus is solely on the takeout experience, ensuring that each order is given the attention it deserves. The absence of tables and chairs speaks to the on-the-go nature of the city life, catering to customers who appreciate quality food in the comfort of their own space.

The charm of this sushi spot is not just in its food but also in its unassuming presence. It's a place you might miss if you're not looking closely, but once discovered, it becomes a regular pitstop. The only regret one might have is not ordering more – a sentiment I share deeply, wishing I had indulged in just a few more of those delightful rolls.

In conclusion, this sushi establishment is an essential destination for those in pursuit of a genuine and exquisite sushi adventure. It stands as proof that the most remarkable experiences often come in unassuming forms – exemplified here by the modest yet profoundly gratifying sushi rolls.

ChIJ7crVtQiRwCwRS3shSQTcz08,Ichi Izakaya,Darwin_Palmerston,Vi S,2,"I’ve been to over a hundred ramen shops in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan, and the ramen here is an absolute disaster—truly terrible.

The soul of ramen is the soup, and just one sip of this soup makes it clear that it’s made from soup powder rather than simmered pork bones. It also leaves an extremely thirsty feeling after drinking, which suggests an excessive amount of MSG—already a bad sign.
Next, the noodles—completely lacking the aroma of eggs, overly soft from soaking too long, and not chewy at all. It’s no different from cooking instant Nissin ramen from the supermarket at home.
Then there’s the so-called “wagyu.” Seeing wagyu on the menu was initially exciting since most Japanese ramen comes with pork or chicken chashu. But this wagyu was a massive disappointment—tough, chewy, and lacking any beef aroma. It felt like a piece of boiled beef brisket that had just been taken out of a soup pot. After two bites, I couldn’t eat any more.
The soft-boiled egg wasn’t runny, but at least it wasn’t fully cooked, so I guess that’s passable.
I understand that this is Darwin, and I wouldn’t expect the ramen quality to match Japan’s, but when it’s worse than simply buying Nissin ramen and beef from the supermarket to cook at home, it’s really not worth the price.",6 months ago,28-03-2025,-12.4630284,130.842161

As you can see from the photos, it's a beautiful venue, with so much potential.

Pre-covid, this was a pleasant restaurant with a good menu. The standards, service and overall quality have fallen since they re-opened post-covid.

The menu online does not reflect what's actually available. The service is slow (I've only ever seen one person occasionally present for the staff, often you have to seek someone after sitting in an empty restaurant for 5+ minutes), and the food is adequate at best. Their steak ordered medium rare was more medium-done. They advertise wagyu on their website but only standard supermarket steak in reality.

The only redeeming feature is they are part of the AccorPlus program, so up to 50% off food.

I really wish they'd put more effort into this restaurant, there is so much potential. Even just reaching pre-covid standards would be nice.

The number calls him back and then my partner asks for the order to be cancelled. The person on the phone said the order couldn't be cancelled and that he would have to call her manager.  My partner asked her to call her manager and tell them to cancel the order. She said she couldn’t and my partner would have to call. After some back and forth my partner gave up and the person on the phone said the manger would call him.

I honestly have felt ripped off. But when I opened the pack and saw that beautiful piece of snapper...awesome. The fish was fresh and was battered well, hot but still crispy. The seafood sticks were good, if only a little on the soft side but had some crispy bits. The chips were above average for fish n chip stores but the amount was a super let down. If you thought $6 of chips could feed your family you’re wrong. This review would've been a 4 or 5. The chips definitely have affected my rating. If I had only bought the fish, it would be 5 stars easy.

They also do some of the best coffee art I’ve seen! Check out their Instagram if you haven’t already. Casual vibes, great service, and clearly a local favourite.

Imagine if this had been a wedding or another major event — the consequences could have been far worse.

This level of disorganisation and lack of accountability is beyond disappointing. It makes me question how this place is even being run. Perhaps the staff are overworked and underpaid, or maybe there’s simply no training or communication in place. Either way, all we received after the chaos was an insincere apology that felt anything but genuine.

The tuna also could have benefited from a little more seasoning. Although was very good.

So with the marginal negatives out the way the other dishes including the oysters were exemplary.

Service was somewhat friendly, seemed a little forced.

The food was disappointing. I ordered Betty's Fish and Chips. The fish was overcooked, although the serving size was generous with 2 large pieces. The chips were undercooked and I just couldn't eat them. The salad lacked dressing but the Tartare sauce was flavoursome.

My meal sat on the counter for awhile, there was no urgency to serve. The Chef had to double ding the bell (again) requesting service. Considering there was only 6 other patrons, this was also disappointing.",4 years ago,03-05-2021,-12.4049573,130.8797007

Sometimes it's takeaway, other times it's dine in or just a cocktail or two. It's wise to book a table, as it gets busy. There are specials every day and the roast dinner on Sunday, for $25.00 and a free drink,  is my favourite. There is a pool for a quick dip before dinner. The toilet floors get a bit wet, especially the disabled because of the pool, so be mindful of that when you visit them. There is a smoking area and a pokey room, if you want a flutter.

ChIJe8aJ1oSRwCwReT23Sz7jz30,Lagoon Bar,Darwin_Palmerston,Joy Debnath,3,"If you don't have time to visit Bali, then Lagoon Bar is your next best bet to replicate the Bali atmosphere.

A pleasant swimup bar, only available to guests at the Mindil Beach Resort/hotel (formerly Skycity). Ideally you'd get a lagoon room which direct balcony access to the lagoon, but staying in the standard hotel area will still give you access.

I'd love to rate this place higher, unfortunately two factors hold it back:

1) lack of flexibility in the menu
2) cost of drinks.

I understand that hotels are expensive in general, but the cocktails here, while well made, are priced at Singapore levels (ie. extremely expensive). I think these might be the most expensive cocktails in Darwin!

As for flexibility, asking for a martini, seeing that they have all the ingredients at the bar, and being denied saying they only serve whats on the official menu, is disappointing, especially given the high cost of drinks.

I don't know whether to recommend it, but if you can't make Bali, then this is an acceptable 2nd choice.

We were not disappointed. Gabriella was friendly & professional, seating us promptly in a comfortable booth. She was very attentive with our drinks orders and food. Our cocktails left us wanting more.

We shared oysters topped with limoncello sorbet, scallop crudo and tempura scallops on corn & gherkin puree. All deliciously delicate and flavourful. My absolute favourite, the crocodile shortribs in smokey chilli and mango glaze, served with a fresh slaw and char grilled corn riblets.

Chef Morgan came to the table to check on the evening. He convinced us to squeeze in some home made icecream and apple crumble..

ChIJQXsAKgmRwCwRdkvQ9I73zvo,Moorish Cafe,Darwin_Palmerston,Louise Kean,5,"We enjoyed a Friday night dinner at Moorish cafe, in July (peak, dry season). We booked a table for 2 online which was easy. The vibe is pretty young & hip, including the music, although the meals could easily cater to a variety of ages. Thete is an extensive menu & drinks list. We ordered 5 different tapas, which were all delicious! The staff were all very attentive & organised. Although we will happily award a well deserved 5 star rating, a couple of small pieces of constructive criticism though; we thought the music didn't suit the international / spanish / culture & style of the restaurant. And the order that we received our tapas was not in the order of how they were found on the menu, & felt the order in which the items were listed should have reasonably reflected the order in which they were enjoyed.
We felt the prices were very resonable for the high level of the food & service. Definitely a centrally located restaurant to visit and enjoy whilst in Darwin.

I understand venues get busy but waiting for a glass of wine 15 minutes goes beyond any excuse. Mains took a good 30 minutes. Initial drinks order got an item missing, I had to double check if that was still coming however it was never sent through the system from the beginning. Service was bad and place lacked atmosphere, needs some noise distribution so people can hear conversations within their own tables.
Oh and by the way, I did order the first two bottles of sparkling water but a third one was brought up by the staff without actually requesting it…. Yet the drinks we did ordered took ages to arrive at the table. Kind of weird, in the end I had to pay for it. Overall bad experience due to service being so neglective.

They were really friendly and said they will see what they can do and sure enough next day we were upgraded. The cleaning staff was lovely and very friendly as well as the reception. They had live music almost every night but that wasn’t annoying.
The Cavenagh also offers a kitchen with literally anything you would need. The pub was very popular with the locals and tourists. Pool area was clean and nice too.

You might be wondering why I’m giving Palmerston Tavern a full 5 stars!! well, let me tell you why.

First of all, the customer service was exceptional. I wish I remembered the lovely lady’s name, but she was incredibly kind, attentive, and welcoming — the kind of service that makes you feel right at home from the moment you walk in.

Now, onto the food... where do I even begin?! I ordered the rib fillet with salad, chips, and pepper gravy, and let me just say... WOW. It wasn’t just a meal; it was an experience. The steak was cooked to absolute perfection — tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The pepper gravy was rich, velvety, and packed with just the right amount of kick, elevating every bite. Honestly, the combination took me straight back to my childhood, those comforting, hearty meals that warm your soul.

If you're in the mood for a proper grilled steak or meat dish, Palmerston Tavern is the place to be. It’s not just good, it’s unforgettable.

To the chefs: give yourselves a pat on the back or better yet, a raise!

Keep up the incredible work, Palmerston Tavern. You’ve definitely earned a loyal customer here.",2 weeks ago,16-09-2025,-12.4806844,130.9837077

Very much enjoyed that side of the visit. Although expensive…but that’s just NT standard. They give you free wifi coupons but the speeds are basically 0…

The prices in the shop are very steep. Understand they’re fairly remote, but $40 for a 6 pack and pack of chips left me limping back to my room.

And the old bloke that takes orders for breakfast shouldn’t have a customer service role here. Very rude and blunt to everyone he served. He asked how I’d like my eggs offering poached, fried and scrambled. I asked for scrambled. He didn’t inform me it was a $3 extra charge for that. When I asked why I was paying more he barked back at me “You want scrambled. It costs more for cream”

Must be bloody good cream if a splash costs $3. Or maybe it’s the extra wear and tear on the chefs wrist I’m paying for?

Steak for dinner was great though. Overall a good stay, just expect to pay a lot and deal with a grouchy old man.",3 months ago,24-06-2025,-13.041677,131.024239

ChIJJzN4QoORwCwR-NDpT_e0-zk,il Piatto Restaurant,Darwin_Palmerston,Delano,5,"Il Piatto is one of Darwin’s best restaurants.
Their woodfired pizzas 🍕 and handmade pastas 🍝 are top-notch, with the beef ragu pasta being a standout dish—rich, hearty, and full of flavour. The mains are equally impressive, but the real star of the menu is the CSG cocktail (CLARENZ Special Gin) 🍸 – hands down the most refreshing and perfectly balanced drink on offer. It’s a must-try.

The atmosphere is relaxed yet refined ✨, and the service is always on point. Special mention to Dustine, the restaurant manager – an absolute legend 🙌 who’ll always find you a table, even when it’s packed.

If there’s one area for improvement, it would be the steak offering 🥩. A better selection of premium cuts, especially something for sharing like a wagyu bone-in ribeye, would take the menu to the next level.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Five stars all around. Highly recommended.

ChIJYdoJzgSRwCwRn4ljCar0_Ew,The Precinct,Darwin_Palmerston,Stephen Pinter,3,"I recently visited the Precinct bar and had a mixed experience. On the positive side, the young lady playing guitar really carried the vibe of the place, creating a lively country atmosphere that made the evening enjoyable. The location is fantastic, right at the waterfront, with nice alfresco seating that offers a lovely view of the pool and grassed area. It’s definitely a spot where people gather to enjoy good music and drinks.

However, the food left something to be desired. I ordered chicken wings that were significantly overcooked, to the point where the meat wouldn’t separate from the bone. The burger was exceptional, but I had to remove the bacon since it was uncooked.

While the staff were extremely friendly, my table was unpleasantly sticky, which detracted from the overall experience.

Despite the food issues, I appreciate the good price of the burger & chips at $22, as well as the regular musical entertainment. I would consider returning, but I’ll be more careful in choosing my meal next time. Overall, this pub has huge potential, and with some improvements in the kitchen, it could be a great spot to enjoy a meal and some live music.",3 months ago,13-06-2025,-12.4663597,130.8470141

It was an okay meal, the prawns and rice were great - we just wished it came with more sauce. So much left over rice with no sauce to eat it with.

In my opinion the steak (surf n turf) was cooked beautifully, the prawns were cooked nicely too, and the gravy was awesome! I just wished I ordered more fries instead of salad.

The Territory Taste Platter is not worth ordering again. At all. The Crocodile fillet was incredible, I wish that could of been a meal on its own. We need more places in Darwin that offer more Crocodile options!! However the reason im giving it a 4 stars is because the kangaroo tasted absolutely awful, we couldnt finish it. The salad was just bad. Im so sorry, maybe I came on a bad day, but the mango dressing just doesn't go well with the salad. I feel like the mango dressing should be an option, as most people (myself included) aren't big on having fruit in salads alongside savoury meals, but thats just my opinion. I think a simple vinigarette dressing would of gone a long way.

Picture this: a beautiful afternoon after the Darwin Show, with the gentle breeze playing through your hair, and the peaceful, laid-back atmosphere setting the perfect scene for a delightful meal. And there it was, the pièce de résistance: the Bánh Mì Chảo.

This isn’t just any bánh mì, it’s a hearty, belly-filling masterpiece. The two eggs, perfectly cooked with golden yolks that ooze deliciously, are the stars of the show. Add to that a succulent sausage and a generous serving of xíu mại, and you’ve got a combination that hits all the right notes.

But wait, there’s more! The gooey, melty cheese adds a rich layer of indulgence, while the sardines bring a touch of the sea to your plate, fitting perfectly with the show-side setting. The beef? Oh, it’s tender, juicy, and absolutely satisfying.

Every bite is a symphony of flavors and textures, from the crispy baguette to the savory meats and the creamy cheese. It’s the kind of meal that makes you smile with every mouthful, perfectly complementing the chill, serene vibes of Portside Char.

So if you’re looking to enjoy your afternoon with a bang, head over to Portside Char. Enjoy the beautiful, breezy show views and treat yourself to a Bánh Mì Chảo that’s sure to leave you feeling full and happy. Trust me, your taste buds will thank you!",a year ago,26-07-2024,-12.4705091,130.8490592

Unfortunately the food quality vs price is where it fell over. We ordered the sizzling beef, honey chicken, pork dumplings and 2 serves of steamed rice. Both the mains were tasty, but nothing amazing or different. The dumplings tasted good but were quite dense (only got 3). Steamed rice was very close to being under cooked, nearly crunchy, and may have been sitting out for too long as it was very dry.

It took 2 waiters and close to half an hour for us to have someone come and take our orders (we did go to the counter to make an order but we were told again that another waiter would come to our table in 5 minutes)

Let's start with what was good.. the pancake machine and tinned peaches.
At least I could tell these items were fresh.

The rest was borderline depressing for a large hotel chain's breakfast offerings.
Is someone reusing last night's dinner for today's breakfast?, because that is the vibe I got. The offerings are just odd and not done well at all.
Carrots in the mushrooms
Kransky in some strange vegetation mix
Uncooked tomatoes 🍅
What looked like last night's dry old noodles.
Dumplings undercooked and oily.
Not only did these offerings taste sad, they also were cold.. not even at safe food temp which I feel is pretty easy to accomplish.
The cold side offered:
Dry cracked cheese slices and rubbery ham.
Croissants that had become almost stone like.
Tinned and some fresh fruit.. the cold side definitely felt safer to eat. The yougurt however was lumpy and watery all at the same time so maybe avoid that.

The staff are lovely, perky and attentive, the coffee was great. The restaurant itself is cosy and clean. Only the food felt dirty and not in a good way.

But the waitress literally dropped the food on the table and left without a word.

So if you crave certain Korean dish or drinks (Japanese drinks also available), it is sure to be on the menu. All dishes ordered were well made, well presented, timely and taste truly wonderful.

The atmosphere is well decorated to provide an authentic Korean home soil feel. The friendly faces and welcoming feel from staff made the experience really enjoyable. I would love to hear more K-pop, but that's my opinion and should not reflect negatively on the host.

ChIJOe_fwAiRwCwRpC_4YR94lEc,Rydges Darwin Central,Darwin_Palmerston,Kat’s Book reviews,1,"I recently stayed here with my mum,

There was so much false advertising for this hotel and we were very disappointed,

There is no bar or restaurant attached when we booked we were under the impression that there would be a buffet breakfast available at the restaurant and bar attached to the hotel, they aren't open so instead we where given 3 options a day at a local cafe down stairs and around the corner, while it was nice after 9 days it got boring and we weren't allowed to use the vouchers for any other meals so we ended up loosing money and giving them to the staff at the Rydges to use.

We had to pay an extra $29 per night for car parking, the card details were taken upon check in and since leaving we keep receiving phone calls about payment when it has already been paid for! It shouldn't cost any extra to park as it is.

The pool is very small and doesn't look at all like the photos online.

The shower didn't drain properly so had to stand in about an inch of water during a shower and no body wash was in the container.

The beds were really uncomfortable and my back was killing me the whole time we stayed there.

There isn't even a microwave available to use in the room. No cutlery to make anything we had to buy plastic knives and forks.

When they clean your room they don't clean the room properly. We had to ask for extra toilet paper after they had already been.

Overall very disappointed in our stay and the general consensus with other people I spoke to staying there felt similarly.

I wouldn't recommend staying here the city was really dead apart from on the weekends.",2 months ago,21-07-2025,-12.4631627,130.8412579

As a Diamond member, I would have loved an upgrade or a room with a view, but I understand the hotel was under construction at the time. The first night was a little disruptive, but thankfully no work happened over the weekend.

From the moment I checked in, the welcome cookie was a nice touch, and breakfast was incredible—especially the juice station and being able to enjoy it poolside. The pool itself is fantastic (the best in Darwin, in my opinion!) and the gym, while small, was well-equipped. My only issue was that the gym key card was faulty—I had to get it replaced three times in a single day.

The room itself was comfortable and well-kept, and overall, I loved my stay. For comparison, I also spent a night at the Hilton up the road, which was nearly double the price. Honestly, the DoubleTree was far better—friendlier service, a pool about four times the size, and a nicer location.

The staff were consistently friendly and helpful, always ready to assist. I also really enjoyed the food, which was of good quality. A major plus for my stay were the fantastic gym and swimming pool facilities; they were clearly well-maintained and a pleasure to use.

While the room itself was simple and adequate, I found a couple of areas that could significantly improve the guest experience. Firstly, the shower pressure was quite disappointing, making for a less-than-ideal start to the day. Secondly, the in-room TV felt a bit dated, lacking the smart features and streaming apps (like Netflix) that are common expectations in modern hotels.

Check-in set the tone — total chaos, like walking into a Dance Moms convention with Honey Boo Boo and JonBenét Ramsey lookalikes running wild. Not exactly the calm welcome you’d expect from a Hilton.

The pool is in serious need of a revamp (see photos) — tired, small, and not at all what you’d expect from a Hilton charging premium rates. By contrast, I’d just spent three nights at the DoubleTree for half the price and had a far better experience.

The worst part was departure day. With a late-night flight, I asked if I could use the lounge to refresh or send emails after a day trip to Litchfield. At every other Hilton I’ve stayed at, this has been a simple yes. Here, it was a hard no. I ended up going back to the DoubleTree, where they were far more accommodating (and frankly kinder).

The one highlight was Gabriel in the lounge — genuinely excellent service, and he makes a fantastic whiskey sour. A small bright spot in an otherwise disappointing stay.

Breakfast itself was good, but honestly, not enough to outweigh the rest.

On the 2nd floor, there was only one shower and toilet accessible. Really slippery in there, and we could hear water from the shower dripping. We had our shower on the 1st floor, but there was NO HOT WATER.About the customer service, the afternoon staff member was really helpful and welcoming, whereas the night and morning ones weren't that much.For the incl. breakfast, there was bread, jam, butter, coffee and milk that you could get from the ground floor.Very NICE sauna area.",6 years ago,16-09-2019,-12.463111,130.8396456

It also has so many staff walking around like they own the place, smoking in the dining area where it clearly states No Smoking, and yet the place is filthy.

Bit of a mixed bag: the bed was comfortable, TV and AC worked, but overpriced for the quality of room. The shared showers and toilets were unpleasant; the cleaners not helpful shutting loos off at essential hours. Shocking noise disturbance outside bedroom window - adjacent small alley. Can't work out why staff have to be cheap on courtesy? Oh wait, a pleasant customer service attitude is too difficult to serve up. In fairness, Chillies would suit some folk but not others.

However, the after hour care taker was not helpful. The hair dryer I received was spoilt so when I asked for another one, she advised there were none. Was able to get another one from the reception the following day.

Location was convenient because we hired a car. Not safe to be walking alone at night.

The room was a horror. It was so run down. The toilet had no proper lock, it was just a hook. It’s pretty baffling. There were dusty black stuffs on the fan. The exhaust fan decides to run whenever it wants.  The beds were also pretty worn out. Some area it’s hard and others it’s soft.

They have laundry facility but you’ll be sharing it with housekeeping.

You can walk across the street to a nice local hotel restaurant (Oaks Elan) with good drink and appetizer prices or around the corner (Ben’s Bakehouse) for very good coffee, danish and lunchtime meals. If you walk a bit further you can be at the lovely park on the water - bicentennial park or the opposite direction the waterfront precinct. Mitchell street is where the Cole’s grocery store is and plenty of restaurants & pubs which again is walkable.

The pool and gym facilities are simple but more than enough to keep you cool, active, and refreshed during your stay. It’s also in a fantastic central location, making it super easy to explore Darwin’s attractions, restaurants, and waterfront precinct without the need to travel far.

What really sets Argus apart is the staff – they’re absolutely fantastic. Warm, professional, and always ready to go the extra mile, they make you feel welcome from the moment you arrive.

ChIJVci_EnWRwCwRImP0jsktGms,Alatai Holiday Apartments,Darwin_Palmerston,Tan. W,3,"We stayed 4 nights in the Studio, 1 Queen Bed unit. The room was a comfortable size for two, with ample walking space and spots to relax, whether at the kitchen table or on the lounge chair before the bed. There’s also a shared balcony that overlooks the car park.

The apartment itself is a little dated, and you can see signs of age with some stains here and there. Still, we were surprised to find a fairly new washing machine and dryer tucked inside the bathroom - definitely a bonus, though there was no washing powder provided (likely something to purchase at reception). The shower area was on the smaller side, and water pressure was quite low, which was the main downside.

The kitchen came well-equipped for basic cooking, and the fridge even had a jar of ice water ready, which was perfect for Darwin’s hot weather. On the downside, one of the cups had a stain, and there was noticeable dust on the microwave and stools. I just gave the stool a quick wipe before using it. The knives weren’t in the best shape either—one had rust on the edge and another was so dented it looked like it had been used to chop a crocodile!

Amenities included soap, shampoo, and conditioner, but no tissue paper—we ended up using toilet paper instead. There was also no hair dryer in the room. Towels were provided, but they left lint on our clothes. On the second day, fresh towels were placed on the table, though not all used ones were cleared away.

Housekeeping was inconsistent. They brought towels even when we didn’t request them, but bins weren’t always cleared—on one occasion, only two out of three were emptied.

Wi-Fi was weak; with just two devices connected, it was already stuttering. The air-conditioning unit was another issue—it leaked whenever set at 25 degrees or lower, so we had to place a bin underneath to catch the dripping water. We highlighted this to Dolly at reception during checkout on 29 September at 8:30 am.

Location-wise, it’s very convenient. Mindil Beach Sunset Market is just a 5-minute drive or a 20-minute walk away, and fast food options like McDonald’s, KFC, and Guzman are within a 3-minute drive.

Good reserved secure parking on site with high clearance. Shower pressure is VERY low, feels like showering under a trickle. You will hear other people banging around in other rooms till quite late.

✅ Rooms are an ok size for one person.
✅ Rooms and common areas all tidy and clean.
✅ Extra pillows.
✅ Cold Airconditioning.
✅ Affordably priced.
✅ Secure, Reserved parking with high clearance.
✅ Staff are friendly and informative.
✅ Woolworths next door makes food shopping a breeze.

CONS:
❌ Shower pressure is a complete joke, it's a trickle at best, very disappointing.
❌ Bed is not amazing. Sprung mattress with a less than ideal topper, not /bad/, but nothing to write home about.
❌ You will hear other people banging around in their apartments till late.
❌ Some local NT residents were having a screaming match out in the street on night 1.
❌ Nothing super close restaurant wise. Either walking a fair bit, driving or getting delivery.

ChIJ-VhTOQiRwCwRaUH6cJx07lA,Mantra on the Esplanade Darwin,Darwin_Palmerston,Cynthia Williams,2,"Our first room, which was for a 5 night stay, was very noisy, we left for a one night stay  at Kakadu and before we left we asked to be moved on our return which was for another 4 nights, because the noise was relentless, doof doof which meant we couldn’t really have our balcony door open.We were moved two doors along and despite our reservations we were reassured it would be quieter, it was not. We requested a front facing room to get away from the noise but were told it would be $85 per night extra. I think we should have been warned by the hotel or flight center, who we booked through, about the noise. The rooms weren’t really clean. We had to request someone to come and clean the dust and mould off the ceiling and air cond vents in out first room, when he moved the bed to reach the air cond vents it was clear it hadn’t been vacuumed under for a long time. Our second room was a bit cleaner but the exhaust fan and vents could still have done with a vaccuum and I found a previous guest’s hair clasp when I moved the case stand. Some of the staff were nice enough but one in particular was  downright unresponsive to our concerns. It was handy having a kitchenette and laundry but I would not stay here again although it was convenient to shops.
There have been food scraps in the hall all day, also I forgot to mention the art work in the halls is moldy and there is a cat with 2 half grown kittens living in the car park and nobody seems to be cleaning up cat poo.

ChIJ-VhTOQiRwCwRaUH6cJx07lA,Mantra on the Esplanade Darwin,Darwin_Palmerston,The Melbie,2,"It is a 3 star hotel & I was not expecting 5 star service & amenities. Location is plus plus. Tour buses will pick you up from here. Walk thru back entrance to busy & vibrant night-life life precinct on Mitchell Street. My city room on the 7th floor was spared the street noise. 5 days here on 1st visit to Darwin which is a  beaut heritage city with authentic Aussie culture.

Pros:
# Location
# Reception staff helpful
# Safe & secure with 2 security coded cards for building & room entry.

Cons:
#Old & dated air-con drone will keep you awake. Light sleepers beware! I got used to it, thankfully. Any longer - I'd sue for audio impairment! Cool enough but no thermostat remote control.
# Soft pillows & bit saggy bed. Ok for me but pax two will test the firmness & comfort.
# Clean but dated bathroom with darkened grouting here & there. All looks adequate on arrival. However with room service policy only on 7th day - it becomes annoying. Paying premium for hotel service but treated like an apartment stay. With Darwin's heat & humidity - the towels are used frequently & need changing. Sheets are not changed either which did not bother me much.
#Shower is in bathtub & old style deep. Those with mobility issues need to be careful. Handrail is attached.
# Trot down to reception to replenish tea or coffee bags. One cup & spoon provided in a pax 2 room. Figure how stained that gets by the 5th day - washing with hand wash & no scrub..
#You are expected to clear the bins by getting down to the basement!! Hello!!
You come for a holiday hoping to get away from domestic duties. Pay the peak season hotel room rate only to be subjected to house work & irritations that detracts from relaxation.

Accor chain need to address this. Stayed at Uluru in July 2023 in one of their premium resort hotels & found it in the same state of very low upkeep & maintenance. Fake reviews to prop up ratings.

My group of friends picked this & I did too. Otherwise- there are plenty of choices on the esplanade or even a little further away. Darwin city is not set on massive city grid blocks like Melbourne is. Easy walk to ocean esplanade views even a little further away.",2 months ago,29-07-2025,-12.4631273,130.8386366

The location is excellent, 30 minutes walk gets you markets, beaches, mariners, major tourist attractions and 1000 eateries and water holes, if your looking for a quieter spot to eat, wandering further away from the CBD (300m-900m) is a good option with plenty on offer...

It is situated perfectly in the CBD, it has fantastic views over the CBD all the way to the harbour, the apartments are massive and the pool and other amenities are great.

However, it's in dire need of a renovation. The first thing you see when you walk in to the concierge is the crumbled, peeling drywall under the vent in the foyer. Our apartment had busted drywall throughout, the ceiling in the laundry was caving in and the tiles in the kitchen were broken and chipped.

During our stay the main toilet stopped being able to flush, we notified the concierge who said a plumber would be there by 10am the same day. No plumber ever came, not for the remaining 4 days of our stay either.

With a lick of paint, some basic fixes and an update of fixtures into the 21st century, I could see this complex being the go to for all travellers to Darwin.

One thing that stood out in this establishment were the staff.
They were always accommodating, patient and friendly.
I noticed 4 different groups of cleaning staff go through in the time we were there.
Some of the cleaners were conscientious and thorough at least half were not.
The room we were in needed a good deep cleaning, the mattress was a hammock and needed replacing, we went through 2 clothes dryers, the sliding door to the balcony had to have its rollers replaced as it was impossible to open.
Kitchen utensils were well past their use by dates, plastic cooking utensils just aren’t very useful.
I personally cleaned the aircon filters twice, the globes for the range hood kept blowing out, the noise from units above us was on occasions extremely annoying, being of concrete construction the whole place reverberates with sound and sonic repercussion.

We have stayed in other Quest outlets around Australia, and have come to expect the equivalent standard of excellence and so the experience of living in the Palmerston establishment for an extended period was an eye opener in that the delivery of service, varies from one location to another.

The negative would be the service. Despite classing themselves as a resort and having a huge pool area, there was no service for food or drink to the pool, you have to walk all the way to the main lobby bar and await the slow service, then go back and get your food when your buzzer goes off, it can be a 50-100m walk given the length of the pool, wastes heaps of time, so this was really disappointing. On top of that, we felt the morning breakfast in the Mercure was usually cold, cramped and busy and the general service from the workers was just quite grumpy and non hospitable. There was one really nice waitress who stood out massively.

Room for 3 is pretty spacious and clean. Toilet was a little too small and water pressure for shower on the weaker side. Nonetheless, the staff service was impeccable. Complimentary breakfast is simple but perfect for a great day start. Else, there are cafe options within walkable distance as well. For laundry, the washing machine can wash a decent load and dryer drys perfectly well. It operates by coins and u can change the coins at the reception.

Chosen because it was part of the All Accor group but this honestly was terrible.  Our shower had mould and 2cm of water than remained in the bottom of the shower permanently, it never drained so you needed to step into cold, mouldy water to shower.  The fire alarm went off late at night on 2 of the 3 nights and on the last day staff visited our room 4 times as the smoke detector was going off for no reason at all.  There were no bedside lights at all, needing to turn off lights at door and walk in the dark back to bed.  Absolutely worst I've stayed in and although we made a complaint about the shower situation nothing at all was addressed no communciation at all from All Accor or the Hotel.  Terrible.

- the elevator needs to be serviced, it sounds like it's just gonna get stuck
- the stairwell needed more lights and more signage
- the carpet was just stained
- had dirty towels and dirty linens
-  the bathroom door had stains near the handle
- when fresh hand towels was returned they was dirty

- on the website it had room service
But there was no phone or menu so had to go down stairs
- no microwave to reheat food so it ended up being a lot of take out

- the sounding of the rooms wasn't great  and others just kept going in and out all hours slamming the doors every time. Which then woke me up every time.

- the locking on the doors it self needs to be upgraded to a safer model

- did order a burger from there which was great. Lovely service from the staff in the bar

On arrival, the staff were very nice and suggested we stay on the cheaper site for the entire stay to save us from moving around as we made 4 bookings. However, they didn’t mention the rate difference or offer any credit.

When we asked, we were told the price had changed between the time we booked and when we arrived – which wasn’t true, as the same rates were still showing online. After 30 minutes of going back and forth, management finally agreed to issue a credit, but not for the full amount.

In the end, the credit was never processed. Their T&Cs stated credits could only be used in Darwin Discovery Park, but we’ve stayed at Discovery Parks many times before and credits could always be used across locations. Also, they refused to give coins credit for the use of washing machine because “how do we know you will use the coin in our washing machine”
We are making this review not because of the credit amount but for the handling of the situation, felt dodgy and left a very poor impression.

Check-in took a while - I would say a good 10 minutes from arrival to being greeted/served at reception.

They gave us all a bottle of complimentary water.

The pool was really cold and unbearable. Of course, it's dry season, so I should've expected that, but the steps leading into the pool were very slippery. I couldn't work out if it was the finish of the stairs or if it was mould build up. Despite there being a rail, I couldn't help but think how an older person may go getting in and out of the pool.

When we walked into the apartment, there was a very strong mouldy smell. I'm not sure if the apartment above has a water leak, but each time we walked out and came back in the apartment, had the same strong mouldy smell.

The beds were extremely comfortable to sleep in with nice pillows, in saying this I did notice that when lifting the quilt and flat sheet up that there was quite a lot of hair all over the mattress, indicating the sheets were not clean. One bedroom fan was working as it should, and the other bedroom fan was on its way out. It was running very slow with minimal airflow.

The shower gets luke warm and doesn't get hot . I feel like Oaks Darwin has really gone downhill to when I first stayed there not long after it was built.

The outside windows were also pretty filthy. It's not what I was expecting for the price we paid.

ChIJ__Hfl6CRwCwRuT63zfY_Ml4,Down Under Hostels on Mitchell,Darwin_Palmerston,James Furniss,1,"I'll begin by saying the backpackers employed to run the place are lovely and do the best job they can.

However Dingo Moon Lodge was easily the worst hostel I have stayed in during my travels.

I was awoken at 3am to find myself being urinated upon by a drunk girl passed out in the bunk above me. Next morning the owner, Jason Hanna, gave me a refund for the night (paid for by the girl) but offered no apology, only 'this happens all the time'.

The girl at reception allowed me to wash my soaked clothes (washing is not allowed between 6am and 2pm) as I was checking out that morning anyway. However I went to my car and when I returned to retrieve my clothes the owner pushed the gate closed in my face and refused me entry! He said I couldn;t enter as I had checked out already and shouldn't be using the washing machine out of hours! I told him he was being unreasonable. He responded 'tough, you're not getting your clothes, go away and come back in an hour or two!'

The owner was the most grotesquely rude, arrogant and vindictive man I've ever had the misfortune to deal with. He isn't fit to run a lemonade stall. He instructs his staff to refuse to extend the stays of those who have been there a while, as they don't book tours! The man is obviously concerned solely with money and not his guests.

I had also pointed out many of the hostel's other failings to the owner, to no effect. He did not apologise for the fact that homeless people get over the fence on a night and sleep in the sunloungers by the pool, wandering around and using the facilites. This is especially concerning as there are NO lockers in which to store your valuables. In fact there aren't even any cupboards or hooks to hang your clothes, so the floor is strewn with your room-mates belongings. Non-residents also come and go as they please throughout the night.

The kitchen is outdoors, and as food is stored exposed on open shelves the place is overrun with cats and possums at night.

The showers are not the dirtiest I've seen but the sinks were blocked, one washing machine was filled with dirty water and the air-con in my 8-bed dorm was broken - the noise prevented adequate sleep on the nights I wasn't being micturated upon. Again, no hint of an apology from the owner.

The WiFi is nonexistent and the free breakfast consists of tea, cereal and crumpets - no milk.

Avoid this place like the plague and go over the road to Crocodilly or one of the other hostels on Mitchell Street.",8 years ago,10-07-2017,-12.4596274,130.8366005

​Before we could even explain our situation, she shouted at us that the reception was closed. We calmly tried to explain that we were in an emergency situation, hoping for a shred of understanding or assistance. Instead, we were met with a complete refusal to even consider a solution. There was no discussion, no flexibility, and certainly no compassion.
​Working in the tourism and hospitality industry requires a fundamental appreciation for human contact and a capacity for empathy. The individual we encountered possessed neither. Her behaviour was not just unprofessional; it was deeply unkind. One has to wonder about the kind of life that leads to such a cold and dismissive attitude towards people in need.
​I genuinely suggest she reconsiders her career path, as she is clearly unsuited for any role that requires customer service. This was a truly shocking and disheartening welcome.",a month ago,03-09-2025,-12.4966584,131.033964

The only negative comment I would make is about the boom gates - they are very slow, the entry pin pad is very loose and wobbles about, and the exit boom gate took absolutely ages to lower when the car in front had gone through. So we spent more time than necessary at the boom gates.

I have no idea what the owner/manager is thinking. The kitchen is so dirty and they never wash and clean the kitchen nor their electrical appliances. They must be stupid to think that anyone could clean or cook in that dirty kitchen. Their family room was $220 with a very dirty and uncomfortable bed. They never do room service.

Don’t be silly like me and not check the reviews before booking! I am honestly not sure how this place is still operating.

Arriving outside it looked grim & dirty, I thought “maybe inside will be better”… it wasn’t. First thing you see In reception is a sign that says “NO REFUNDS”.

Now I’ve stayed in budget accommodation, but for over $100 per night you would expect the place to at least be CLEAN! Dead insects, dust & grime everywhere, all housekeeping must do is change the sheets.

It looks like it hasn’t been renovated since it opened, I think every tile in the room was cracked or chipped. Holes & cracks in the walls, furniture looks like it was found on the street, the mattress feels like you are sleeping on car springs covered by a thin piece of paper.

Last but not least the SMELL… it smelled like an abandoned house that hadn’t been opened since the 1950’s, no amount of deodorant or fresh air could get rid of it.

A very poor attempt was made to blow the leaves away (which are in abundance and we understand that this is a nightmare to keep on top of) the pool was HEATED!!!!! Can you believe it? 31* humidity 45%, no need for this.
We did need to change our booking which was done and we were thankful but sitting outside our van at 10:30 we got a call to say we should have checked out at 10:00am and they said they didn’t have any sites left for us. I quickly found another park and booked in. We packed up and then the young groundsman came and said they found a site for us. Too late! When our friends checked out she was spoken to very rudely. Seriously, this place needs to be demolished and rebuilt. So disappointing!",2 months ago,29-07-2025,-12.5081832,131.0170642

We were in a gorg grassy site on the corner of the block with the paddock in front of us and big expanse between our site and fence to paddock with cows & the odd pigs which we saw only tonight in there. Wallabies come out morn and evening and can have a heap of eyes looking at you from the park lawns as they come around the park, round the van sites its fabulous.
So very peaceful.
Pool is a great addition and lovely and refreshing. Other facilities around about the van park are in great working order, the grounds are kept lovely. Friendly and helpful staff.

If you're more into the 'farm animals' Jean is more than happy to give you a tour of her backyard critters.... Emu's, guinnea-fowel, goats, chickens, geese and a naughty group of native whistling ducks. The kids loved it. Very family friendly- Jean made us feel very welcome.

These arts reflect how australian aboriginals have been able co exist with nature without disturbing the harmony of environment for more than 40,000 years. The artists talk about stories, dreams, beautiful country, the nature, daily activities which traces information back to thousands of years before.

It seems like it's in the middle of nowhere, but it's an interesting drive amongst the mango orchards. Mick's place is neat and tidy. A sign says to toot your horn and wait, which I did. Mick soon appeared and showed me some crocodile skin belts. The quality is excellent. They're all hand made by Mick. There were only a few to choose from in my size, but every belt is unique. I wore my belt, so getting the right size was easy. As a keepsake and a souvenir of the Northern Territory, it is unique. I wear it now as often as I can.

My Wife’s Mother was evacuated from Darwin in 1942 after the bombing, so there was family history in Darwin from the outset.
It was a great surprise to see the family lineage scroll, with the names and dates.
So, we contacted the Museum Director to have the information updated to include the Children, Grand Children and Great Grand Children.
Also, as it happens, the Curator and my wife are actually related.
What a coincidence.
Hopefully, this will be completed.

ChIJLTI6CdyRwCwRIQjLR_APqhw,NT Chinese Museum,Darwin_Palmerston,Aneka Truman,4,"Worth a visit to learn about how Chinese people influenced the development of Darwin and the Top End.

The museum was very informative, there is a lot of information to read and it could do with some updating, but I enjoyed the experience and learned some new things.

Cost is extremely reasonable at $4 per adult and payment is cash only. Only open on certain days/times, or by appointment. Check before visiting. We visited on a Sunday at midday, I believe it’s open 10-2 on Sunday’s.

The Chinese Temple, next to the museum is beautiful and has a lovely story. Definitely worth a visit. I believe the Temple is open every day.

Need about 1 hour to look around the Temple and Museum. Longer if you want to read everything in the museum.",2 years ago,12-03-2023,-12.4624208,130.8446072

Walking through the museum, you get to see an impressive collection of army trucks 🚛, uniforms 🎖️, and historic weapons 🔫. The displays are well set out and give you a real sense of what Darwin went through during the bombing raids. The multimedia presentations and exhibits make the history feel alive — it’s not just reading information, it’s like stepping back in time.

ChIJQ41nfNSdvywRWOOQO8TUEmI,Top End Safari Camp,Darwin_Palmerston,Kiralee Honor,5,"Our stay at Outback Safari Camp was nothing short of spectacular from start to finish. Traveling with our three children, we were thrilled to see their eyes light up during every activity—from the heart-pounding roar of the airboat ride to the excitement of feeding saltwater crocodiles up close. The helicopter flight over the floodplain gave us all a bird’s-eye view of this breathtaking landscape, and nothing beat the thrill of landing on a remote billabong for some world-class barra fishing.

Back at camp, the combination of a crystal-clear swimming hole framed by red escarpments and the relaxed vibe of the open-air bar created the perfect setting for parents to unwind. The food was a genuine highlight: fresh, flavorful, and served with that warm Outback hospitality you dream of. At night, our family sank into the spacious, safari-style glamping tents, where comfortable beds, and private decks made us forget we were miles from civilization.

ChIJMVHEY_aRwCwRa-DAfoAQ144,Bung and Sool Bake house & Restaurant,Darwin_Palmerston,Sze Mei NG,4,"Came here twice at least.
Venue: A beautiful place. Romantic decorating. Cozy but causal setting. Larger outdoor area. Lovely background music. Good atomphere. Clean & tidy. --- 8.2/10
Service: run by Koreans. A ""Call button"" under the table to call for order and service. No tap water provided. Wait persons were polite. The young girl was nicer, smarter and always smiled. Besides washing bowl, ought to give us extra big bowl /plates for shells when we ordered seafood tower. Better introduce more about their menu especially somethings had been changed from menu. As we asked, told to wait 25 minutes for Seafood Tower. --- 7.5/10
Food & Beverage; Menu was old and torn. Mainly western cuisine with some Korean dishes. No wine list was given to us. Doesn't mention the ingredients of Mocktails. Only know the main fruit juice of the mocktails. Beautiful presentation.
- Mocktail, $11@: tried Paloma Fizz (Grapefruit).
- Homemade Iced Tea, $8@: Tried Yuzu Green tea. Good value. Good portion.

- Seafood Tower, $149 for 2pp (-- 7.6/10): Price is slightly high but acceptable. There are 3 tiers. Top tier is 4 pcs of thick Salmon slices, colored in red (?by beetroot juice) served with apple puree on the bed of green salad. Pretty good and yummy. Much better if served tidy.
Middle tier:  4 Baked scallop with cheese, 2 Pan fried Barra steak, 2 deep fried Pepper Calamari. 2 round Fish cakes. Served with ketchup and mayo and the bed of other green salad. We ate the scallop immediately, but the cheese became harder as cooled down. Scallops were small. Barra steaks was normal. Calamari was big pieces and ok, not so pepper.
Bottom tier: 7 sucked oysters (3 oysters were original flavor + 2 different flavors), 7   garlic butter prawns, 1 Spicy Crab, 1Garden Salad with ? dressing (didn't ask, didn't tell what dressing). Oysters were very small but fresh. Prawns weren't de-veined (disappointed for that. Supposed de-vein in a decent restaurant). Good size but Lack of garlic butter flavor. Crab was good in flavor and size. Large portion of salad (lettuce, carrots, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, spinach & onion) ok fresh.

- Cakes: There are a lot of cakes displayed. It says Korean style cakes. We took Earl Grey pound cake, $6, and Chocolate Banana Cake, $8. Look pretty. Reasonable price. We took away cakes only. They didn't use usual fancy cake box for my cakes. Chocolate banana cake is taller and softer than pound cake. It's easier to be deformed/compressed by the  brown small box. It's better using higher container.
- Chocolate banana cake is pretty yummy. Good in texture. Also not too sweet. My cake was deformed slightly before home. --- 8/10

ChIJL-rljpGRwCwRN9x0tPR7UFc,Yots Greek Taverna,Darwin_Palmerston,Gabriela Eneas,1,"My birthday dinner turned into a disappointing experience.

I chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday with 17 of my friends. I made the reservation in person, confirmed it again via email and voice call, and everything seemed in order.

However, at the end of the evening, the owner approached me directly at the register and asked if I wasn’t going to pay the entire bill. I explained that each guest would pay for what they ordered — their own food and drinks — and when I paid for my own meal and drinks, I was informed there was a $30 fee for bringing my own birthday cake. I said I would pay it, but also asked why wasn’t I informed earlier?

She replied that it was normal and that all restaurants charge this fee. What she didn’t know is that I have 11 years of experience in the hospitality industry, and I’ve never seen anything like this in my life.

Nobody mentioned this fee during the in-person booking, email confirmation, or phone call.

As the situation unfolded, all my guests stood up and came to the register to pay, forming a line. After the first guest paid, she turned to me and asked, “If someone doesn’t pay, will you cover it?” I looked at her — still in disbelief about what was happening — and said, “Don’t worry, nothing will be missing.”

Thank you, Ana, for giving me the worst customer service experience I’ve had in my 38 years.

On a positive note, I want to sincerely thank the chefs  the food was truly delicious, and many of my guests complimented the flavors and presentation. Unfortunately, great food alone doesn’t make up for how poorly we were treated.",2 months ago,06-08-2025,-12.4509422,130.8225606

ChIJL-rljpGRwCwRN9x0tPR7UFc,Yots Greek Taverna,Darwin_Palmerston,Carolina Criado,1,"We went to Yots yesterday as a group of 17 girls to celebrate a birthday. Everything was fine until the owner started rudely asking the birthday girl if she was going to cover the bill. She repeated this several times, raising her voice and using very expressive face, saying that if anything was left unpaid, the birthday girl would have to cover it.

At that point, there were still 15 people who hadn’t paid yet, and the birthday girl said it was fine, that she was sure everyone would pay and nothing would be left outstanding. Despite that, the owner repeated herself two more times in a very condescending way, as if she didn’t trust us at all.

In the end, of course, everyone paid and there was nothing left on the bill. So there was no need to talk to us like that. On top of that, the owner charged the birthday girl $30 just because she brought her own cake — even though, it was not mentioned when she made the booking and our total bill was nearly $800.

For comparison, the night before we celebrated at another Greek restaurant, Meraki, and the experience was completely different. The owner personally came to the table to congratulate the birthday girl, happily stored the cake in the fridge at no charge, and kept checking that everything was perfect at the table. That’s what true hospitality looks like.

Unfortunately, despite the food at Yots being good, neither I nor any of the 17 girls will ever return. The service provided by owner Ana was TERRIBLE, and her arrogance ruined what should have been a special night. It feels like a place that only cares about money, not about their customers — and Ana clearly have no idea how to deal with people.

ChIJQQxslJGRwCwRQ9fuhdJCeyY,Lola's Pergola Darwin,Darwin_Palmerston,Dariu Szewski,5,"I visited Lola’s Pergola last month with a group of friends for a casual mid-week dinner. The restaurant is located on the west side of Cullen Bay, right next to the docking area. It was a fairly busy evening, with most of the tables occupied.
I had the Barramundi fish and chips and a beer. The fish was delicious with a mild, buttery flavor and a flaky texture. The dish came with a side salad and a couple of complimentary sauces. The portion was big enough to be filling. Overall, I can definitely recommend the fish and chips. The pizzas also looked good, though I didn’t try them.
As for drinks, I noticed a wide variety of beers, including some locally brewed ones — so if you enjoy trying local treats, it’s a good place to come.
Food and drink orders are placed at the bar but brought to your table. We were told there would be about an hour's wait for the food, but it arrived in around 40 minutes. The staff was friendly and professional.
Lola’s Pergola has a laid-back atmosphere, enhanced by some quirky, luna park-themed decorations. The boats docked nearby and the view of the bay add a nice ocean vibe to the setting.
Food and drink prices were average, though they also offered some 10$ specials.",2 months ago,01-08-2025,-12.4505681,130.8230799

ChIJ2UWYkwqRwCwRcI8iRQVLADQ,The Cinema Collective,Darwin_Palmerston,han jay,1,"Hey guys leave this please the “pink hair manager” is not only rude but also irrational.
So my friends and I were here just for a couple of drinks, we arrived at around 9:10pm and still feel hungry, we noticed that the kitchen was closed so we went to the counter to buy some snack for drinks, but the staff said no snacks here.
So we decided to get some snack outside to eat.
Only some chips and cracker.
And then the lady came with a rude attitude to us “ you can not eat food from outside here, it is our policy, if my venue manger see it, I am gonna be in trouble” (seriously? Your venue manager will come and blame you for this? If yes, I want to suggest him/her to extend kitchen operation time please)
Even though we could partially understood for that excuse but she said balabala about the policy, which does not help for our hungry belly. Kitchen closed, no snacks.

She was very rude and upsetting customers here(there was only a few guests though,but it looks crowded in other pub at the same time) , we are Darwin local and we just wanted a good day to share and talk with our friends. But with this “pink hair policy” manager in here, I am pretty sure it is not a good idea. She left us with “ do you understand?” “ that’s it, end of story”

How ridiculous, I feel lucky that I am not working for her, for sure she is not eligible for managing a pub.

PS: I remember the “pink hair” manager said “ if you go to domino, can you bring food and drink in? “
Okay, I just wanna make it clear that domino does not close kitchen during their service time, and also the pink hair must not know that domino also has 100% good food guarantee, which means if you are not happy for the food, you can get a refund. Do you understand that, can you refund my drink for your arrogant customer service, pink hair?  I am not sure it is a good idea for you as a manager to compare this pub to an international company, which does not make sense to us.

It was just a paid day Wednesday night, not even on the weekend, this stupid and arrogant attitude will not help for the business to last long.

Btw: the ginger beer was flat too, focus on your service and quality, otherwise potential guests will turn around, and learn from the best pub, to be better, come on, I am sure your venue manger wants to see more about profit and good comments rather than this type of drama.",2 months ago,16-07-2025,-12.461163,130.838172

After the food service area had closed (the food section was already cleared out by 8:45 PM), we were not allowed to consume anything—even though we were clearly hungry. They offered no food options and even refused to let us eat our own snacks.

Despite the fact that we had already ordered drinks, they attempted to force us to leave. We tried to reason with the manager, asking for just thirty minutes to finish our drinks before leaving, but she refused, and responded with blatant hostility, even going as far as involving security in an aggressive manner to have us thrown out.

This was hands down the rudest and most disgraceful service we have ever encountered. It is no surprise that other bars in the area are full while this one remains empty.

ChIJ35BJTJGRwCwRDx0jE0-kWxA,"The Bali House - Cullen Bay, Darwin NT",Darwin_Palmerston,Jeff A.,4,"Bali House provides unique accomodation in the style of a Balinese house with lots of open air spaces. The house is located in a beautiful part of Darwin right on the water in Cullen Bay. It's a short walk around the bay to a wide selection of restaurants and cuisines.

The house consists of 4 pavilions surrounding a 10m unheated pool. The pavilions house two bedrooms (double storey), one bed room (single storey), common lounge/kitchen area and a separate pavilion for dining. Both the kitchen and dining pavilions have nice views of the bay and moored boats.

Each bedroom has its own bathroom, in the open Balinese style. This may be a nice experience for some, but might be bothersome for others who prefer a more enclosed environment.

Every bedroom has air-conditioning as does the dining pavilion. The top bedroom on the double storey pavilion can get ghastly hot, but does cool down reasonably quickly with the aircon.

There is an older flat screen TV in the kitchen/dining pavilion, and a smaller TV in the top floor bedroom.

There are two lovely outdoor seating areas, one undercover off the kitchen pavilion and one exposed near the private jetty.

There are also plenty of nooks and crannies where you can curl up with a good book. The dining pavilion has a pretty bench seat framed by views of the bay.

A laundry is hidden away in the corner with dryer, washer and ironing board.

Overall we really did enjoy ourselves for our week stay.

Just a few observations:
* The house really does need a little refurbishment.
* Particularly all the horizontal surfaces, table tops, benches, bench cushions could do with some rejuvenation.
* We were here at the beginning of the wet season, and if you are mosquito prone, there are a LOT of them. Particularly in the outdoor bathrooms
* There is no WiFi, which is quite surprising in this day and age.
* The TV does need an upgrade to a smart TV to allow guests to stream their own entertainment (assuming there is WiFi)
* Cellular reception is excellent and fast
* If you plan on cooking check there is gas supplied to the cooktop (there is a separate gas BBQ). There did not appear to be any gas during our stay.

It is also surrounded by a variety of restaurants and cafes where you can even get takeaway food and alcohol if you don’t want to leave your spot on the grass.
The wave pool is also located here and makes a great whole day activity or it is also very easy to pop in for an hour or 2 as there is a multi-storey carpark with 3 hours free.

Cons: only 1 family sized bench, no BBQ, skate area is a joke, shade, too many useless bins, abundance of aesthetic wood fixtures, many scattered rocks increase hazards.
no play ground: single swing and it's not under shade, two slides and 1 rope play spot, only enough room for 1 and a half families.

ChIJzcZCKvGmwCwRgLnNbqoDr6g,The Didgeridoo Hut and Art Gallery,Darwin_Palmerston,Daniel Arndt,4,"Located at the intersection of Arnhem and Stuart Highways in Humpty Doo. We almost drove straight by the entrance drive, if it wasn’t for Google Maps. The entrance is an adjacent to a large asphalt car park for an Agricultural chemical business, which questions whether you’ve reached the right place or not. The gallery is up a small path, over an earth mound and through some trees, almost impossible to see from the road or car park.

The gallery itself is a collection of dongas and sea containers around an open courtyard. Worlds away from your upmarket galleries in Darwin. The unframed indigenous artworks are contained in cardboard portfolios and horizontal filing cabinets. The didgeridoos stacked up against the wall. A little scary to see everything stored with little respect to protecting them against the elements. The quality, design and authenticity of the artworks however is far better than most/all of the galleries we’d seen in Kakadu.

We were greeted by the most laidback bush territorian, who told us to have a look around and let him know if we were interested in anything. We ended up finding the perfect painting, and felt we didn’t end up paying some extravagant commission.

It was certainly worth our while making the stop at the Didgeridoo Hut and Art Gallery. It reflects the old adage don’t judge a book by its cover - you certainly find some gems here if you prepared to look.",2 months ago,31-07-2025,-12.5666689,131.075259

To make it even better there's a fishing pontoon so you can catch barra while your kids play on the playground or join you to fish.

We ordered steak and onion burger and a chicken and mushroom risotto.

Today we personally thanked the chef and told him how enjoyable and delicious his meals were and for sharing his love in his creations.

With about ten minutes still left in our session, we were abruptly told to pack up and finish because the next group was waiting. It felt rushed and cut into the time we paid for, especially after also spending a good amount on food and drinks. A short turnover period between bookings would make a big difference so players aren’t forced out early.

The scheduling seems too tight - having new groups booked exactly on the hour leaves no room to wrap up or clean up in between. On top of that, the venue felt understaffed for how busy it was. We were having issues with our simulator and it took a while to get assistance, and food orders were being taken to the wrong tables.

The food is ok, the corn ribs and honey soy boneless fried chicken is the best, the rest is ok, arancini balls aren't great.
The mini golf is very challenging, there are 18 holes. Surprisingly the lower numbers are harder than the higher numbers and most of them are luck-based rather than skill-based! Takes approximately 1h to do all 18 holes

We had a wonderful time at Hologram Zoo in Darwin! The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring that our children had a great experience throughout our visit. The first stage of this exciting project has been completed, and they're already hard at work on stage two, which is expected to be ready by February.

The zoo offers a unique experience compared to other children's attractions in Darwin. It's also a fantastic venue for big group celebrations, including birthday parties, with plenty of food options will be available soon in February . One of the highlights for us was the Christmas theme, especially the “Flying with Santa” experience—it felt like I was actually riding on Santa's sleigh!

The Photo Booth was another fun feature, allowing you to choose from various themes to take memorable pictures with dinosaurs, jungle animals, and more. It’s an experience the whole family will enjoy—both kids and adults!

What impressed me most was the team's commitment to improvement; they actively sought feedback from visitors on how to make the experience even better. Special thanks to Roman, Rajib, and their amazing team for creating such a memorable experience.

ChIJm9lzeou9wCwRcF-iWcZB_9c,Hologram Zoo Darwin,Darwin_Palmerston,Daniel Marsh,1,"Extremely disappointing. Overpriced and we are still slightly confused about what we paid $100 for.

My wife and I decided to take our 2 year old son as we thought it would be a nice family activity to do together.
The building itself had a strong stale smell inside, like curry on the stove.
It was staffed by an 8 - 10 year old boy that was directed to give us the 3D glasses, these were smeared with dirty fingerprints you could hardly see through them.
He then proceeded to lead us to multiple curtained booths while mumbling instructions about what we had to do and how many times we had to do laps of the same areas.

We originally went to do the dinosaur experience but you couldn’t buy this on its own, (no wonder) it had to be bundled with a main attraction, in this case the hologram zoo. Turned out the dinosaurs was a one person at a time hologram so the family had to sit and wait while we took turns to stand there and try and work out what was going on. Not what we there expecting as a family experience.

There was plenty of space in the venue for the kids to run around and enjoy themselves freely, which made the whole event feel relaxed and stress-free for the adults too.

W,5,"Our tour started at 11 am, but you’ll need to be there about 15–20 minutes earlier to exchange tickets and wait around the café area. Just before 11, we were asked to head past the playground to wait for boarding. The cruise was packed, but thankfully our guide was the real MVP—without him, we wouldn’t have spotted half the crocs! He kept things fun too, giving the crocodiles names and sharing about their habitats with plenty of humour.

Although it’s listed as a one-hour tour, ours stretched to about 1 hour 15 minutes because some cheeky crocs took their own sweet time. The guide had to tease them quite a bit before they finally leapt (and sometimes missed, which was hilarious to watch).

Price: AUD 68/pax before fees (including VAT or GST, if applicable). For 2 pax, the fees was AUD 7.42. Total at AUD 143.42

The toilets block is old and you get eaten alive by mosquitoes while having a shower and they have no disability facilities.

ChIJ74Tkd2OUwCwRzc5o8TDQVvk,Red Rooster Marrara,Darwin_Palmerston,Lewis Moore,1,"Extremely Concerning Hygiene and Food Safety Issues

I am writing to formally express my deep dissatisfaction with my recent experience at Red Rooster.

The older gentleman working at the tills demonstrated behaviour that raises serious concerns regarding hygiene and professionalism. While preparing my food, he was repeatedly touching his face, which is entirely inappropriate for someone handling meals. He appeared to recognise me from a previous visit where I had not been given a receipt, and his attitude seemed noticeably unfriendly.

What followed was completely unacceptable: he went to the back of the premises, visibly adjusted or pulled up his trousers, and upon returning, placed my chicken into the box using his bare hands. This is a clear violation of basic food hygiene standards.

Additionally, I had ordered a vegetarian burger, which was packed together with meat items, resulting in cross-contamination. This is not only careless, but also potentially harmful to individuals with dietary restrictions or allergies.

This experience has left me deeply concerned about the standards of food handling and customer service at this location. I urge management to take immediate action to address these issues and ensure all staff are trained in proper hygiene and food safety protocols.

Until then, I will not be returning and cannot in good conscience recommend this establishment to others.",3 months ago,05-07-2025,-12.396171,130.897109

Beautiful views of the river and plenty of croc sightings. This isn’t just a gimmicky tour where you do a quick boat ride to get some cheap photos of jumping crocs. We did see plenty of jumping crocs, but the guide, Rex, made it more than that, telling the stories of each one and how they interact with each other.

ChIJ8YcnxY6ruCwRMtdYbrxJIWc,Croc Spot Tours,Darwin_Palmerston,Alexandra O'Neill,5,"My family and I had a fantastic cruise with Rex. Being on a boat that only seats 20 was great as we got so close to the crocs and everyone had a great view, no matter where you sat. Multiple crocs got so close to the boat during their jump that they touched the boat. Its obvious that he has worked with these crocs for years, his passion, knowledge and experience shone through. He knew where to find every croc, how they preferred to catch their prey and how to read their body language.  He knew all their little quirks and it meant we saw heaps of crocs. Despite being in a smaller boat, we never felt unsafe, at times he would stop trying to feed the crocs to gauge their behaviour, making sure that he didn't create competition for food between the crocs we got surrounded by. He also made sure that the weight of the boat was evenly distributed, which meant that the side of the boat not closest to the croc could stand up and get an amazing view. While this did mean sitting next to strangers, after 2 hours you all become mates anyway, this just speeds up the process. Our 2 hour tour ended up going over (which no one had any issues with) to make sure we got to see a large male croc up close. We learnt a-lot not just about the individual crocs on the river but also about crocs in general, their ecosystem on the river and their conservation story.  We also got to see a Sea Eagle as well as multiple Black and Whistling Kites catch their food up close. I cannot recommend this tour more, if you are in Darwin and are toying up between tours, this is THE one to do. We have left the tour with amazing photos and videos, a deeper understanding of the Adelaide river and its crocs as well as a knowledge of croc safety and conservation.",a month ago,26-08-2025,-12.6585999,131.3364569

The education and stories to know the hierarchy of these amazing creatures once in a life time. Its more of a personal experience because of fewer people. You can see the owner and guide is passionate and loves these amazing creatures. He went over time to make sure we got the best experience we could and had a decent yarn with me to help with my extreme fear of crocs.

ChIJRXhkd5OUwCwRdJv6lFJySZ4,Pizza King since 1989,Darwin_Palmerston,Britt Wilson,5,"Nervous based on other reviews, but gave it a try (from interstate). As they were quite negative will write a detailed review of our experience.

Was told it would be 30 mins, waited for food (not delivered) and it was indeed about 30mins.

Store would benefit from facelift & hole in roof being repaired (likely landlord issue not theirs). Waited in shopping centre which was a pleasant space & browsed at other stores windows.

Service from staff was fine for a fast food environment (no different to most), though the customer service could be warmer / chattier from the young chaps (Rinaldo was lovely).

Can only speak for their pizza. We had gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza, base was lovely, lots of toppings, chicken was beautiful & fell apart. Not at all oily, or burnt (as others mentioned), was crispy and well cooked, good amount of cheese.

Meatlovers / supreme (not gf) was also really good. Oilier than gf bbq chicken, but probably due to having more meats like ham / bacon on it. Definitely not too oily though, crispy, lots of toppings, well cooked and very tasty.

Sizing could be a bit confusing for some. I'm from Adelaide, so their mini is our small, their small what I consider medium, their medium is my large and their large, my family. With that in mind prices seem more reasonable & worth it for the amount of toppings and quality.

Would definitely recommend them to others. Give them a try for yourself, our experience didnt match others reviews. Yum 9/10 pizza 🍕 photo only shows half as half was already eaten 😋",a year ago,23-06-2024,-12.3777556,130.8960849

The rooftop setting is beautiful with amazing views of both the city and the ocean.
It really feels like a hidden gem with a relaxed vibe and modern atmosphere.
What made it even better was the thoughtful extras complimentary nibbles and canapés (both hot and cold) lollies for the kids and plenty of non alcoholic drinks for those of us not drinking.
The staff were welcoming and friendly and everything felt well organised but still casual and easy going.

It is a bar on the roof of a 16 story hotel over looking Darwin city with 360 degree views.
Open from 3 to 9/10 every afternoon. From 3 to 8 they put out all you can eat complimentary snacks that you can help yourself to with any $10 purchase from the bar. From lollies, biscuits and dip, and salads, to hot food such as chicken wings, sausages and lasagna.
Unfortunately the restaurant does not open for dinner atm in the hotel. But they don’t mind if u bring your own food or use food delivery services if have a bigger appetite.

It is so relaxing and peaceful up there, the staff are so lovely and if you are lucky the owner who built and designed the building might even come say hello and buy u a drink.",5 months ago,20-04-2025,-12.4598849,130.8463326

The barramundi was cooked perfectly, decent size and flavoursome with laksa style broth. The Seafood laksa was perfectly cooked, broth was rich, very tasty. The mango panacotta was delicious. The attention to detail..look at the pic with the tiny macaron.

ChIJmTwnSQ-RwCwRNe1mG8Sch3M,Lazy Susan's Chinese Restaurant Darwin,Darwin_Palmerston,Mango,5,"Had their soft shell crab (entree), Peking duck three ways (poultry), kinto pork spare ribs and spicy salt squid.

The soft shell crab was okay. The legs were good but as you keep eating to the main body, you can taste a really fishy smell that not even the dipping sauce could cover.

The Peking duck three way was amazing. The pancakes were warm, the duck meat was good (though the skin could be crispier) and the sauce was amazing. The duck soup is really nice to drink. The duck fried rice is what you would expect of a normal fried rice.

The kinto pork spare ribs is the star of the dish for me. The ribs were fried to perfection and the sweet tomato sauce goes so well with it. Would definitely recommend this.

The spicy salt squid is the star of the dish for my partner. I loved it too. I'm glad it had a slight kick to it as I couldn't see much chilli on it and thought it was going to be a plain salt and pepper squid dish.

Overall fast service despite being full house. The waiters were friendly too.",4 years ago,31-12-2020,-12.4627318,130.8431333

The whole crew is super knowledgeable about their products, the different ways to experience & drink. I like to think I know a bit about gin, but the team taught me new ways to experience gin!

The Desert Lime & Darwin Festival Gin’s are worth trying; as is the Darwin Sling cocktail!

Maddie was so much fun, full of laughter and excitement. She has great recommendations about their menu, and you can truly tell how much she loves her job! The other bartender, who’s name I forgot, but she was absolutely excellent! She makes beautiful, flavourful drinks.

ChIJ2bzuXZ-UwCwRZGbfB8lah_g,Nando's Casuarina,Darwin_Palmerston,Bobby Sandhu,5,"Amazing Meal at Nando’s Casuarina!

Food:
Our meal at Nando’s Casuarina was absolutely fantastic! We ordered chilly broccoli, serious large peri-peri chips, garlic bread, pitta bread with hummus, and a full extra-extra spicy chicken—and everything was perfect.

Chilly Broccoli had a great smoky, slightly charred flavor with just the right amount of spice, making it a delicious and healthy addition to our meal.

Serious Large Peri-Peri Chips were crispy, golden, and packed with that signature peri-peri seasoning—every bite was full of bold flavor.

Garlic Bread was soft, buttery, and had a rich garlic kick that paired beautifully with the meal.

Pitta Bread with Hummus was fresh and warm, and the hummus was creamy and well-balanced with a smooth, nutty taste.

Full Extra-Extra Spicy Chicken was the star of the meal! Cooked to perfection, juicy on the inside, with that fiery heat we were craving. If you love spice, this is a must-try!

Service:
The staff were friendly, fast, and attentive. They made sure everything was spot on and served our food quickly despite the busy atmosphere. It’s always great to see such a well-managed team ensuring a top-notch dining experience.

Atmosphere:
The restaurant had a lively and welcoming vibe. It was clean, well-organized, and had a comfortable setting to sit and enjoy a meal. The background music added to the experience without being too loud.

Overall Experience:
This was a perfect Nando’s experience—flavorful food, excellent service, and a great atmosphere. Everything was fresh, tasty, and cooked just right. Highly recommend Nando’s Casuarina for anyone looking for a delicious meal with bold flavors. We’ll definitely be back for more!",8 months ago,26-01-2025,-12.3757678,130.8819787
ChIJ2bzuXZ-UwCwRZGbfB8lah_g,Nando's Casuarina,Darwin_Palmerston,Van Hoang,1,"Visited Nando’s Casuarina for the first time yesterday and had a very unpleasant experience. I requested my sauce to be served separately from the chicken. The front staff told me it wasn’t possible, which I was fine with, and I said that in that case, please cook the chicken normally. Before I could finish my sentence, the staff rudely cut me off multiple times. Her attitude felt dismissive and discriminatory. Later, when I collected trays, utensils, and napkins, they were messy and greasy. When I asked the same staff member if they were clean, she looked at me with a judgmental and condescending expression and didn’t give me any clear guidance, which made me feel very disrespected. Overall, my first visit was extremely disappointing.",in the last week,30-09-2025,-12.3757678,130.8819787

Sadly, the experience was terrible. We had to check several tables to find a clean one, as most hadn’t been wiped after customers left. There was water and leftover food scattered everywhere, and many tables remained uncleared long after diners had gone.

The restaurant floor and tables looked dated and dirty. When we went to get some cutlery, there was none available. After asking the staff, they handed us a set, but it had an unpleasant smell, as if it hadn’t been washed properly with hot water.

Some staff members also seemed uninterested and not very attentive. Compared to the Casuarina location, the Palmerston Nando’s is much better in terms of cleanliness and service.",2 months ago,05-08-2025,-12.3757678,130.8819787

The grilled corn used to be smeared with the sauce, now it is just a plain grilled corn. Totally a rip off.
Restaurant also do not have a bottle of table water. When asked, staff said they only have 1 bottle which is now in use by other customer and they do not have anymore bottle of water. Tables are dirty, ambiance of the restaurant looks gloomy and sad.

Coffee was great. I requested for extra hot, and got it as I wanted. We were group of 4 friends from Brisbane  and we though of sharing the breakfast. We ordered 5 different items to share and really enjoyed that. The big breakfast came a bit late, but was perfectly cooked. Grilled mushrooms was yummy. We tried tacos and it was so great. Perfectly cooked and filled with. We all enjoyed tacos so much that needed up visiting second day for that. Other food item were great and deserve 10/10.

Despite of very busy breakfast rush, the staffs were very professional and helpful. The lady who made our coffe was so humble. (Forgot her name but she mentioned she is from Nepal). Thank you so much for your warm hospitality and professionalism.

While the bar is not the most well stocked, you should be able to find something to drink as they have some wine, beers, spirits, and mixers.

I'm sad to say that their food has not been very good the two times I've eaten there.

They have a wonderful wood-fired pizza oven but they overload their pizza with cheese and it's so heavy you can't pick up a slice without it sliding off and therefore, the base is undercooked in the middle.

I've ordered tapas there also.  Woefully under-seasoned, and some items on their menu are not as described. For example, tempura battered cauliflower, is actually crumbed cauliflower, which was cold on the inside, and the crumb was warm - served with 3 generous sized pieces with no dipping sauce or dressing at all.  Their croquettes were also crumbed, and the béchamcel sauce was very loose, so they didn't hold their structure and collapsed once the fork touched it (also 3 generous sized pieces per serve - also needed something to season it). Their meatballs in red sauce, what can I say .... the sauce was warmer than the meatballs, and it also needed seasoning.

At Beaver we had the Mango lager and the jack jack lager, which were both good and prices were ok.
Only 5 outdoor tables are in the shade, due to the heat we ended up sharing a table inside with another group. Surprised they don’t have outdoor umbrellas for the other outdoor tables, as even the afternoon sun in Darwin is spicy.
We were really excited to experience a brewery in Darwin as there’s only 2 in town, but were disappointed with the experience at Beaver, unfortunately.
Beaver brewery has the better beers only by a smidge, but One Mile brewery has much better service and the brewery has a lot more character",2 months ago,11-07-2025,-12.3997094,130.8545911

Just a heads-up—don’t rely on the photos of the menu or cooked meals, as they’re no longer available during the week.

I used to love coming here after dropping my kids at daycare—grabbing a coffee, enjoying a proper breakfast, and getting some work done a few times a week. Unfortunately, that’s changed.

When I mentioned my disappointment about the lack of cooked food and that I might have to find another spot, the response I got was, “Oh, we’ll see you later then”—with a bit of attitude.

I’ll probably hold off on coming back until they offer more than just sandwiches. I love a good cooked breakfast, and if I wanted a sandwich, I’d just make one at home.

If the limited menu is due to staffing issues, that’s understandable—but a little communication would go a long way. A polite explanation would be much better than sarcasm, especially when there are six other cafés within a two-minute drive.",5 months ago,30-04-2025,-12.3869711,130.8506284

ChIJjQofaECVwCwRMn9D_YnAySE,Burrito Bar Casuarina,Darwin_Palmerston,Shel Inglis,3,"Sure thing! Here's your review done up with a proper Irish tone — warm, a bit cheeky, and full of that dry Irish honesty, like something you'd hear in a Dublin pub or down in Cork:

---

Ah sure, we gave the place a lash, didn’t we? Thought it’d be grand — and parts of it were, to be fair — but Jaysus, the rice was a sad affair. Soggy as a wet sock left out in the Galway rain. Like, did they cook it or drown it for sport?

Now in fairness, the spice saved the day. Lovely bit of heat — not the kind that punches you in the face, more like a slow burn that gives you a nudge and a wink. Tasted like someone in that kitchen knows what they’re at, at least with flavour.

And the lettuce? Would you believe it — class altogether. Fresh, crunchy, bit of a snap to it. You’d nearly write home about it, like. Probably the happiest leaf I’ve eaten in weeks.

So look, it’s not a disaster. Keep up the good work loves",2 months ago,02-08-2025,-12.3712887,130.8837629

---

Ay nako, this bar has the best Paloma in all of Darwin, promise! Super refreshing, perfect balance—grabe, I could drink three, no joke. The cocktails overall are top tier, talagang masarap. The place looks so nice, I swear I wanted to steal all the furniture—so aesthetic, parang Pinterest! But one thing, ha, no food at all—so if you're hungry, kain muna before you go. And no more free popcorn, sayang naman. Plus, you need to ask pa for a key to use the toilet—medyo hassle. But still, drinks are worth it.

We started with dahi puri, which was filled with flavors, but the sweet sauce flavor was dominant. The chicken tikka was tender and decent. The salted lassi was great, with a touch of jira powder. For the main course, we ordered goat curry and jeera rice, based on the staff's recommendation. The goat curry was fantastic, not too spicy, not too mild, and tasted just like a homemade one. The jeera rice, on the other hand, was just plain basmati rice. It could have been better.

The puris were soggy and looked like they were sitting out for hours. The paste/stuffing inside tasted old and stale. It had a weird smell and flavor that made it completely unappetizing.

To make matters worse, my husband actually vomited after eating just one pani puri. It was that bad. This is totally unacceptable and raises serious concerns about hygiene and food safety.

Please take this feedback seriously — no one should have to go through this kind of experience from a simple street food item. Definitely not coming back amd order again.if my want to rate is so I will give -100",5 months ago,26-04-2025,-12.3795258,130.8489361

ChIJMc4kPACVwCwR4-qsPDR7WKc,Gurambai cultural walking trail,Darwin_Palmerston,J Seth,4,"The concreted trail starts at the bridge on the way to the airport to the end of mercure hotel area about 650m. The concreted path is about 10min walk one way, wheelchair and pram friendly (the bridge entrance is quite steep). It is connected to the resort as well. However, there is no direct parking to this area that connects to the concreted path! The only feasible way for wheelchair is to stop on the road side near the bridge (there is not even road shoulder to safely pull over). The resort entrance has steps and only accessible to hotel guests.

This newly concreted path is along the rapid creek river, local children technically swim in this area but there can be crocs plus the creek is contaminated with PFAS.
The trail is very easy and flat.

The trail continues with the bushwalking woodland area for another 2km one way. Gravel/dirt/mud not wheelchair friendly but an easy track to walk.

Can see many native birds here, best to do it in the morning, or at night if you want to see nocturnal birds.

Bring hats, sunscreen, sunnies, mosquito repellent.
No toilet.
There's only one water fountain around the resort.

In dry season it's a great hangout for walks, wildlife wonder and beautiful beaches (no swimming unless you want to come up close and personal with a saltwater crocodile....   definitely not recomended... always be #Crocwise.)

Also there is a bird hide for shorebird season, coming up soon in Darwin.

Sunset gazing, and rock hole exploring is viable.

In build up it can feel very challenging but then in wet season it is also magical. Bring your binoculars but leave your dog at home. From the point east it is a no doggy area. Hopefully nature lovers like myself around the world will be able to #saveleepoint from the bulldozers so we can truly call Darwin home to some great nature.",a year ago,10-07-2024,-12.33052,130.8945128

There are some fantastic places to camp (( BUT PLEASE WAIT FOR THE TIDE TO TURN ON START THE RUN OUT AS THERE ARE MANY STORIES OF THINGS GOING EXTREMELY WRONG VERY QUICKLY IF YOU DON'T RESPECT THE OCEAN))) .. just a view that is spectacular especially when the sun starts to drop over the ocean wow . Please respect the land and remember what you come in with make sure it leaves with you as there is plenty of evidence around to . With fishing an beach driving and tracks for 4wd and the old jail in there to look at to which is something to see . Just take care as there is a person living out there with dogs so take care especially if children are with people travelling.  But this is a great place to explore.. please remember that there are crocodiles around there area extreme caution around water be croc smart .... The tracks have some nice deep muddy holes that have plenty of depth and water to them some spots look firm but are not so watch for those spots some good hill climbing for the 4wd . This is stunning place . Don't forget the mozzie repellent and the coils ...... These photos were of today and we were begin watch by this big boy he was cruising around were the creeks run out into the ocean and he didn't care he was anywhere from up on the beach to 400m off the beach and to top of a cracker of a day my daughter caught he 1st barra better than sea snakes like the other day ... The old jail is out there a lot of the structures are still out there as well along with some top fishing as long as your vehicle is up to it because some of it is not easy as the photo's show but that's the adventure getting there great place to explore and see,2 years ago,05-05-2023,-12.24285,131.03035

It was a real gem for visitors who like Aboriginal art, especially contemporary Aboriginal art.

I was and still am a novice in Aboriginal art, and have very limited knowledge except about dot painting and Rainbow Serpent Dreamtime picture. I spent sometime at the gallery exhibiting the many colourful artwork, and masterpieces.

Besides painting, there was the Corkwood Sculpture Garden, and a great display of metal work.

These two joined museums deserves so much more credit than they get, and if you visit make sure you have the time to properly go through it all.

ChIJJ-CVsSoZMisRY-N_zdAqeOA,Alice Springs School of the Air Visitor Centre,Alice_Springs,Sandra Haindl,5,"My first visit to the School of the Air was nearly 20 years ago, back when classes were still conducted via radio. Even then, it was a fascinating experience — a school reaching children scattered across the vast Australian Outback through the airwaves. The concept of providing education over such long distances was impressive and deeply memorable.

Fast forward to today, and much has changed. The school has embraced modern technology, and all lessons are now delivered online. Through specially developed digital platforms, students can join live classes, interact with their teachers, and access educational resources, all in real time — no matter how remote their location may be.

The visitor experience is compact but very well designed. In a short but engaging tour, you learn how the school operates. The exhibition area includes short documentary videos, interactive displays, and historical artifacts that trace the evolution of distance education in Australia. One of the highlights is the opportunity to observe a live class in session. Through large viewing windows, visitors can see teachers conducting their virtual lessons, offering a unique glimpse into this unconventional classroom environment.

What struck me most was the passion and dedication of the staff. Teaching children who may live hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away requires not only technical skills but also creativity, adaptability, and empathy.

The School of the Air in Alice Springs is much more than just a school. It's a pioneering institution that has evolved with the times while staying true to its mission: making education accessible, no matter the distance.

We were two couples who stayed overnight and had dinner at the homestead. While dinner was a reasonable cost at $35pp (cook your own steak, salads and potato bake) the drinks were outright daylight robbery!
One couple had a piccolo of white wine, and two Coopers beers and were charged $75!
The other couple had a piccolo of white wine, a can of Sprite and an instant coffee and were charged $50!
I could understand if the property was remote, but we are talking 40km from BWS in the heart of Alice Springs.
With an absentee owner, the staff have been flown in from the eastern states and had no local knowledge at all - to quote a staff member - ""I only flew in, so I've only seen the road from the airport to here"".
We arrived at the gate to find it locked (even though our confirming email said it is NOT LOCKED). We called the number on the gate only to get voicemail. We did get a call back and were told we should have received the combination to the lock in an email (neither of our couples had received this).

ChIJ7am7flAZMisRz5Dl2K3uYY0,Old Alice Springs Gaol,Alice_Springs,Sin Fong Chan,4,"Alice Springs Old Gaol
Visited on 10/7/2019

The compound housed the Alice Springs Old Gaol and the Women's Museum of Australia. The entry fee is for both the ""attractions"".

Since Australia was a former British colony, the word ""gaol"" was used instead of jail, or prison.

Upon entry to the converted residential building is the souvenir shop and sales counter staffed by volunteers. There are some interesting items on sale including local­ly made and designed jew­ellery, acces­sories, home­wares, chil­dren’s gifts, sou­venirs and a range of books on extra­or­di­nary women.

The shop also offers unique, most­ly hand made prod­ucts made by prisoners at the Alice Springs Cor­rec­tion­al Centre, such as metal decorative artwork, aboriginal boomerang, etc.

The gaol was opened in 1938 and oper­at­ed until 1996. It was gen­der segre­gat­ed until the mid-1980’s before becom­ing male only due to over­crowd­ing.

In 1998, the North­ern Ter­ri­to­ry Gov­ern­ment demol­ished all the non-heritage list­ed build­ings on the site. That explains why there are not many cells around to accommodate all the gaolers.

The Women's Cell Block is a long building made of cement bricks. The women doing time here could not be that aggressive or violent, becuse there were beds in the verandah where they slept during very hot days.

It is interesting to read the information posters on the wall outside some cells.

Talka Willian was the matron between 1956 and 1984. She was well liked, and treated the women kindly. From my research, Telka Williams was the Angel of Redemption at the women’s gaol, the saviour of special needs people in Central Australia. The women cooked on benches tiled themselves, in colourful uniforms they designed and sewed, in cells they painted, as they slept on beds adorned with their own hand made quilts.

The men's block is quite different. Many of the inscription, collages and paintings are by inmates can still be seen. Some of the cell doors are locked, but visitors can peep through a small glass-plate opening on the door to view the interior.",4 years ago,31-07-2021,-23.7040998,133.8766218

The rooms were different colors as they moved the prisoners around for a “change in scenery”.

Some of the carvings and paintings on the walls of the cells have been preserved. They range from the depressing, where prisoners were counting the numbers of days they were locked in, to the inspiring, with incredible paintings.

If you have kids, ask at the front desk for a activity sheet, which leads them through the cells and also provides clues to find different things themselves. There are outdoor benches for a rest while the little ones ran around the grounds for a while. We easily spent a couple of hours in the gaol.",3 years ago,21-07-2022,-23.7040998,133.8766218

It shows how early pioneers dealt with the complexities of living and working in Central Australia, and provides a good understanding of the role of The Rev Dr Flynn and the Presbyterian Church of Australia in opening up Central Australia as well as caring for the comminities around Alice Springs and throughout northern Australia.

ChIJVQVkuUQZMisRP5oe7jbHeVw,Subway Alice Springs,Alice_Springs,Emily,1,"We wanted to get a Sunday night sub and went to the CBD Subway instead of the Larapinta one. Big mistake. Everything about our experience was downright terrible.

There was no-one else inside and the glass entry door was covered in greasy handprints. The two young female staff members who served us obviously didn’t want to be there and weren’t polite at all. One girl was using her phone on same the counter where the sub gets made and the other girl was carelessly throwing bits of paper over her shoulder in the bin. Zero care for customer service at all.

It was only after we had ordered that we looked around more and started regretting our decision. All the front windows were dirty just like the door. There was drink and food residue spilled all over the bin. The place looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in months. The vegetables looked bad, very limp and not at all fresh.

While waiting, I read a Google Maps review about how someone felt sick after eating there. But by this time our subs were ready so we felt committed to the order. On the way home I looked at more bad reviews and by time we got home we had both completely lost our appetite and didn’t touch the subs — they were both chicken subs so we didn’t want to risk getting sick either.

I regret not taking photos of everything, it was all just so disgusting. This place should get shut down or have a change in management asap because it was absolutely appalling. We had such horrible experience here and will be contacting Subway management for a refund.",8 months ago,12-01-2025,-23.6998565,133.8810245
ChIJVQVkuUQZMisRP5oe7jbHeVw,Subway Alice Springs,Alice_Springs,Linda K,1,"My Alice Subway review.
I NEVER write negatives but it was a disgusting reflection of the Brand.. which I am proud to be part of...

Would mark lower but 1 star is the minimum.

Ordered 4 platters.
2 classic SUB platters, 1 classic WRAP platter and a cookie platter for a 40th birthday lunch.
I work at a Subway in regional Victoria so had expectations of the same / higher quality and presentation that we pride ourselves on since Alice is much larger than our population area.

Unfortunately in Alice the order was WRONG.. got 3 SUB platters... NO WRAPS... as ordered... upon pick-up i found the shop itself was FILTHY, door, windows n glass not clean, shop had terrible smell not the clean fresh smell I'm used to. The whole place could do with sanitising in the usual Subway style as dictated by the Franchise rules. How they pass the Subway internal spot Audit hoops we have to jump through beggars belief.. sorry.

The platters were sitting on the bench in the shop... not kept refrigerated as we do at our store.
We pride ourselves on the way the platters are presented including serviettes.
This Subway felt like the platter was 'leftovers' and there were no serviettes.

Would NEVER recommended or order platters from here again. They looked like they were thrown together in a hurry, shoved in a platter box and did NOT look appetising at all.

Refer to the photos. They didn’t even cook the order correctly. As you can see in one of the wraps I shouldn’t have got it is raw and not eatable as raw chicken will make you sick.

This is not the first time. I suggest the company get some staff in who actually are aware giving someone raw chicken can make them very sick!

I would appreciate it if there area manager or someone in head office would respond this is ridiculous

Thank you for your below copy and pasted response. I have filled out the form via the link. It’s now been two weeks. And for the general public- I still have not heard from management or an area manger re food safety . Had I not eaten half way through my meal and not realised if could have made me very sick!  Now my question is. What are you serving to children with uneducated staff serving raw chicken as seen above in Protoss I’ve attached. Is not acceptable no excuse.

But the lack of response from an area manger /or manager is blatantly obvious your lack of caring and commitment to your town the service and Quality your producing. With McDonald’s across the road and kfc you wonder why this place is dead and takes 30mjns to get served at McDonalds they’re that BUSY why wouldn’t A chicken store like red rooster wouldn’t want to have some of that business as well they don’t care simple

The Dal Makhani was acceptable mostly except had only 5-6 kidney beans in it.  The Chicken Malai Korma was nothing like it should be, they’ve not used the correct sauce, had no cashews in it and the spice level was way too hot for a mild dish. I’m familiar with the malai sauce from here although usually  get kofta, and this is NOT it. Was unable to eat due the spice level. This has happened twice before, they think they can get away with using a different sauce/curry base with a couple of changes and we won’t notice - no!
The lachha parantha was ok but not exceptional. Final time they will get my custom as there are much better Indian Restaurants in town.

The meat was nice enough but bordering on being uncooked. I think the previously mentioned theory of defrosted/microwaved food could be correct. There is no way a ragu cooked fresh should be that watery. Gave the place another chance. Was happy with how the steak tasted, was more medium than medium rare but that was ok. The potatoes are definitely not duck fat potatoes as described. Lastly the chicken karaage entree had 5 bite sized pieces of chicken and a slaw garnish. For 24 dollars.

Marvellous job done
Staff were nice and friendly.  KfC don't stress Ur crew for beating the time. Let food served as it comes.

23 January: food was good. Boneless chicken came little cold vut my son ate all the pieces he likes.  Boneless chicken is not same as melbiurne , they have ling strip with lots of coating but here they and coating and chicken shape of nuggets. But the boys did the good job, he gave the pieces with lots of coating. My son love the costing. He ate all the 6 chicken nuggets as he like

25 january
Good work guys. The front counter team were awesome and the best thing I found was that the packer was listening to the cashier and filling the box as asked. They also gave the Boneless chicken as coating and he said we don't have long strip one. We order the feast meal and for once the 18 piece which was given was distributed evenly . Theyvhad breast and the chicken part which has meat with burns, drumsticks. Omg the original feed was so much thatv4 adults couldn't finish them. Thevpacking of chicken was nice and each piece tasted yummy. The nuggets the best one so far, just cook right. It wasn't overcook with brown coating. This one was yellowish soft chicken and as we  could taste the chicken and juice. The kids enjoyed their nuggets. Potatoes gravey and colsew all fresh

This is our favourite restaurant now as this crew made our day and since we both are fusy eaters they accommodated their needs. The manager were nice too, needed some help and request she was at the front in few minutes.  So I came here at the restaurant at 9pm.  So this evening team you had has been trained well and it seems the production line and serving lines were working together. The cook in the kitchen knows what they were doing.

ChIJRb8fyUUZMisRj0sueMynDzA,McDonald's Alice Springs,Alice_Springs,Keith & Anne,5,"WOW!  Is this the best McDonald’s in Australia?  We think it is.  We do a lot of travelling and have visited many McDonald’s stores - nothing compares.  We were supposed to be just passing through Alice Springs but instead we stayed for more than a week.  This was all due to the awesome welcoming, friendly and efficient service we received at McDonald’s Alice Springs together with the delicious, hot fresh food and smooth, creamy, aromatic coffee that we thoroughly enjoyed - the best coffee we’ve ever had anywhere.  Kathleen, the People Performance Manager, is just amazing.  She always happily greeted us and other customers upon entering the store.  And what a difference that makes.  Kathleen and the entire crew should be congratulated on their efforts. The Store Manager was also really nice.  Honestly, we couldn’t keep away from the place.  We love this McDonald’s store.  They all work really hard - a fast paced very busy store without compromise.  It is no wonder they are so so busy - everything is just perfect.  It’s all go go go and they have such a methodical team system happening - it’s very impressive.  And we’ve never seen a McDonald’s ‘drive through’ queued to this lengthy extent.  Now that says it all.  It’s certainly an indication of how good this store is.  OMG this is unbelievable.  Impeccable service, great tasting food, flavoursome coffee.  But there’s more.  Squeaky clean store throughout with tables/chairs, floor and toilets all immaculate. The crew even treated us to some unexpected fine table service. What more could you ask for?  We have to say that they made us feel very special at McDonald’s Alice Springs and although we are from Victoria, we just cannot wait to return to this particular store.  Our thanks go out to the entire crew.  May you all be commended and rewarded for your enthusiasm and pleasantries in giving customers just that little bit extra - we really appreciate it.  All in all an exceptionally great store!  😃😃",a month ago,29-08-2025,-23.697341,133.878886

We ordered butter chicken, dal makhani, kulcha, and lachha paratha — and unfortunately, almost everything was inedible.

The butter chicken was incredibly runny, more like coloured water, with just four tiny pieces of chicken. The taste was bland and unappetizing. The dal makhani was even worse — it had a stale, off-putting flavour as if it had been prepared days ago. Both my wife and I took a single bite and couldn’t continue.

The kulcha was passable, but the lachha paratha was dry and disappointing.

Out of a $65 order, around $51 worth of food went straight into the bin. Thank you for making it clear we should never visit again. Extremely dissatisfied",5 months ago,06-05-2025,-23.6970907,133.8897894

We have come here numerous times over the years without any issue. Last night was another story… quite a few people were there, but the empty tables were mostly grotty, sticky. Using the QR code to offer our meals when they arrived I was very disappointed. I ordered the special of nachos and when I took it back to the table I noticed there were minimal toppings and no cheese to be seen. I took it straight back to the counter and the staff in the kitchen used their finger to dig through the food to try and find some cheese… one lady pointed at a dot where there was supposedly cheese while the other person told me they would fix it it and bring it over again. They did return it relatively promptly with an adequate amount of toppings and with cheese! The toppings were only across the top and the rest of the entire plate was stale dry corn chips. Which I couldn’t eat.
On top of this we got the kids meal which was meant to come with a kids drink and activity book.

ChIJ_R1qGfsdMisRKpnwqRSE27Y,Alice Springs Brewing Co,Alice_Springs,Darknstormy Images,5,"Outstanding food, fantastic service, and a great vibe!
Had dinner at Alice Springs Brewing Co and it was hands-down one of the best meals I've had in the Red Centre. We ordered the Kick'n Chicken burger, onion rings, BBQ Clucka pizza, and washed it all down with their refreshing ginger beer—every single item was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection.

The Kick'n Chicken burger had just the right amount of spice and crunch, paired beautifully with their house slaw and crispy chips. The onion rings were golden and addictive, and that BBQ chicken pizza? Smoky, cheesy, and loaded with toppings. The ginger beer was the perfect cool-down—crisp, zesty, and brewed on-site.

Service was just as impressive—friendly, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. The staff made us feel right at home and clearly take pride in what they do.

I’ve eaten here before several times and the orange chicken was delicious.. this time however it was terribly bland.. zero flavour and way below standards of a restaurant let alone one that charges you a premium.
Very disappointed. 😞

Take 2:
Rang to advise I was ordering again as requested. Service couldn’t give two hoots 😂 .. neither could I actually but I was just doing as I was asked.
The honey soy wing entree was great, perfect very nice.
The roast duck ($44 worth) was all bones as pictured… worse it was a lot of micro bones so was just annoying to eat for a start. There was a smidgen of plum sauce which was a watery substance that couldn’t rescue the bony duck from the excessive amounts of salt 😣
As you can see from pics.. we ate everything because we were hungry but we really had to work for each morsel of meat amongst the bones.
Sorry but take 2 was another flop 🤷🏼‍♂️ too salty too bony to be overly enjoyable but may come back for that entree 😋",2 months ago,28-07-2025,-23.7043307,133.854427

ChIJ49GtuSsZMisRVDCjeSQizAU,Grill Me Crazy - GMC,Alice_Springs,Delan Adikari,4,"GMC has an interesting blend of Mexican and Indian food.
They have undergone some changes this year. It was okay before in terms of menu but had broken sign and lack of atmosphere as mostly takeaway/delivery services plus their ice-creams.
But since August the logo has changed, the signage fixed, inside all done up and many diners once again creating a good atmosphere.
I'm not sure if management has changed but staff are good and some changes are still in progress.
The original menu items are still available, but added now is Indian fusion food, including popular street food and to the ice-cream range is kulfi, and some other Indian desert choices. And as mentions the combo of Indian and Mexican food like the Indian burrito bowl.
I find i am paying a little bit more now for dining here but that is because of the options of foods available especially deserts.

We also got the offer to change 1 of the Hake in Seafood Meal into Barramundi just for an additional A$5. As I was dining inside the store on arvo Sunday 28th of July 2024, I saw the orders taken care of effectively, no long waits, even with only 2 staffs.

The atmosphere was adequate. For in-store dining, the oil steams were immediately taken out by the exhaust. You can still catch a little of the steam, though. It’s better to eat in the afresco area when the weather is good.

Unfortunately the food was not to my liking. To be courteous, I don’t think it fits my Balinese tongue as I don’t like excessive oil on my meals. I think it’s more because of Australian taste instead of Balinese. We weren’t asked whether we want our fish crumbed with flour or not. Even so, the fishes were well cooked so I can eat them without the breading. You can also ask for extra tartare or alioli for A$1 each. I also happen to get only 1 seafood stick instead of 2 in the Seafood Meal. Pretty average place, for me.

In short, this place is just an ordinary place. If you want gourmet fish, this is not the place. But remember that you can cook by yourself, like for the schnitzel and chips.

ChIJE4Vza5cZMisR7qSYUGP_dz8,Club Eastside,Alice_Springs,June Crabb,1,"Really disappointed with the costs and quantity of the platters at Club Eastside.

Had two kids birthdays this weekend, both family members.
One birthday at Gillen Club - 8 kids and 13 adults and one at Club Eastside - 12 kids and 10 adults.
Gillen Club we had 6 platters - 2 x meat, 2 x pizza, 1 x fruit and 1 x sliders, just over $500
Club Eastside, we had 8 platters - 2 x meat, 2 x sandwiches, 2 x fruit, 1 x antipasto and 1 x vegan, all up approx $1100.  Add on jugs of soda as well as the takeaway containers.

Sandwiches - egg, ham and salami. $135.
All smothered in some sort of chutney or relish and not one kid ate a salami sandwich.  Who the heck gives out that many salami sandwiches at a kids birthday.

Meat platters - Couldn't find any buffalo wings, unless nibbles are what they classify them as, both had about $10 worth chips (and that's a stretch), 4 Mince pies, nuggets, a few tenders, 4 quiche and 6 saus rolls.  Was this worth $140 - hardly!!

Fruit platter - decorated ok, very thinly sliced, seem like one quarter of the three melon varieties were used.  Could they not afford more than 2 oranges.  For $135 per platter, I'm sure they could.

Antipasto $135 and Vegan $125.  Each had 3 x cherry tomatoes cut in half and the food did not even cover the board.  What a joke!!
The only abundant things on offer were the sauces.

The quantity on the platters, seriously did not justify the cost and I guarantee that it did not feed 10 people, well maybe the sandwiches would have if most werent salami and each one smothered in chutney.
If would have been cheaper if we had just ordered food off the menu.  Would have been well under $1k and everyone would have been fed.

It seems that Gillen Club provides value for money and decent size platter portions.
Club Eastside not as good as it once was for the platter servings compared to a couple of years ago and I recommend that people discuss the platter options with staff to know exactly what you'll be getting

Word of advice, if ordering the sandwich platter, be sure to advise them of what fillings you would like.  I wish I had done so.

Platters from here will not be on the menu for us again.",a year ago,13-09-2024,-23.6970158,133.8912711

Do not choose this motel. Despite locked gate, security is poor and owners are not visible and active in ensuring safety. My car was ransacked overnight and no management available to assist.

Thieves watch the gate all afternoon,
know the gate code and enter in the night.

Anyone can see the scoping out. Staff stay in office and are not proactive. No assistance was provided despite my ringing and asking for help at the office which was unattended.

Nobody on site it would seem?

A cynical grab for cash with no customer care.

I got a call from reception around 11pm one night asking if I wanted my room cleaned the following day. I said no and had my do not disturb sign hanging on the door.
I was very unhappy to discover that they had disregarded my request and come in to 'clean' anyway the next day. My work includes confidential personal printed materials that I had not secured, believing that my room would not be entered. I had had the room serviced 2 days beforehand and so it was not overdue.
I contacted reception about this breach and they apologised, I felt they did not take it particularly seriously.
Two nights later, same thing, a call from reception.  I said no again and explained why but they persisted. I agreed to them   coming into the room late afternoon under pressure.  After cleaning my room, they left a coffee ring from a spillage on the bath and some cleaning materials in the room.
I have posted an image of the razor wire fence around part of the compound,  there are big double gates also topped with razor wire that are left open all night.
I went to use the provided torch to go for a walk and the switch was broken. Fed up, I took it to reception where they told me to replace it and maintenance would address it later. Didn't really help me see my way back, but they did give me a complementary drink voucher.

Extra edit after the lovely message from the owner: you need to chose your line of argument. Either this is so cheap and that's why it's a pitt, or this place is a palace and I'm lying but you can't win on both. You mentioned that we spent 4 days there so you also know we booked at your dump given that I hadn't mention that detail. If other people are OK to live in unclean places, each to their own. But cheap should not equal to dirty. And as said, I did say the rooms are OK so that's why we stayed.

Lights falling off the wall. Busted ceramic shower soap dish that could slice your leg open. Curtains too small and dirty. Carpet has stains and cigarette burns. All the lampshades missing.

We had room 119. The best apartment I have ever been too. It felt like home with all setup. For once I could leave my kid and do my work on the laptop. Both of them (kid and son) were running around. He had his play corner. The kitchen is perfect and they had washing machine in laundry. Good idea to put them in the dishwasher area. I didn't had to go anywhere. Fridge big size I did shopping for two days stay. Didn't had the car so having a kitchen and fridge saved a lot.

The ventilation and air container were working and we had to turn them off as became too cold. We went to reception and was allowed to leave the dog as long as he doesn't make noise
Just need to do grocery shopping. When we came back newnie was fast asleep next to the sofa on his bed.

Was told very abruptly it’s all in the envelopes… So we had to find our own way and own rooms…
The rooms… we were  told weren’t pet friendly, (which we liked) , rooms were very pet friendly, even down to concrete floors, ripped fly screens from paws, dog slobber on glass doors and outdoor area which was meant to be for entertaining, was a dog run.
Shower was blocked up, the water ran around the bathroom and toilet and towards bedroom..,

The heater helped but for sustainability, don't want to leave it on all night! Not at lot of space for luggage so it helped that we could leave things in the car.

From the moment we arrived, the staff were warm, welcoming, and incredibly helpful—they really go out of their way to make guests feel at home. One of the unexpected highlights was their adorable dog, who added such a lovely, friendly vibe to the whole place.

The amenities were spotless—showers, toilets, kitchen areas, all exceptionally clean and well-maintained. It’s clear that the team takes pride in keeping the park in great shape. The pool was a real gem—crystal clear, refreshing, and just what we needed to relax and cool down after long days exploring the area. It’s a perfect spot to unwind, with plenty of space and shade.

One thing that stood out to us was how safe and peaceful we felt the entire time. That sense of security is so important when you’re on the road, and it made our stay even more enjoyable. Another unexpected bonus was that there were very few flies or mosquitos, which can be rare in the Outback.

Quite close to the town - about a 10 minute drive. And very close to the Alice Springs Brewing Co - eat in or take away. Their pizzas are great!
The amenities block is a bit dated but it was very clean, with really hot showers. This is also a dog friendly park so it was nice to see the dogs as well.
The owners are doing their very best to get the park updated.
The community kitchen had electric jugs, microwave, toasters, BBQ and lots of chairs and tables - they even have a large screen TV on the wall.
Contrary to another reviewer's comment about there being no dump point, I'd like to state that there is a dump point near the amenity block!

Advised he’s only recently taken back over after a long journey with previous management and he, his father and the rest of the team doing a power of work to get things up to speed.

Facilities were a little run down but as I said they are truly pushing out the work to get it up and going. One of the best showers I’ve had I. 7 weeks!!!.

The team dog sat out two dogs Juni and Marley for portions of 3 days and with plenty of kennels out back I’m sure would be more than willing to do so for others.  This is how the business was originally built on dog friendly principles.

Dogs wash was great again needs tweaking to fully get back up and running and with a great free time area for the dogs I can’t talk more highly of this place if you have dogs.

Time will be the making of it and given they have only had it back for a few weeks it should be a great park once again.

Staff were unhelpful, no sense of urgency to find us another place and said there would be no support to move my items, then after I insisted, was offered a lesser quality and sized room (studio). management finally contacted after I insisted they contacted me, questioning why I didn’t notice the infestation sooner then criticised me for having so many items in the room after stating she’d seen a video of my room which I find to be a breach of privacy given the video staff took was of the kitchen cabinet to show the termites, not to inspect my living arrangements, with her stating the apartment was not kept to her ‘standard’ (single mum working fulltime and hadn’t had a chance to stack or pack away items neatly since moving, cleaning old unit for the last week after having my car stolen making living circumstances hell, all while caring for my son on my own, and planned to pack away on the weekend), making me feel at fault for needing to be moved rooms and like I should be grateful. Again requested help moving items and was told staff would help move items 2 metres from 1 veranda to the other so after having to take the day off work to AGAIN move, I had to move my items my self in 43 degree heat.

ChIJj9ZMda0bMisRZJXlOuTc_LU,Gap View Campground Alice Springs,Alice_Springs,Kym Robey,2,"We just stayed at this campsite over the last few nights. We booked based on what we saw online, without having checked it out first. The plus side in our opinion, is that the campsite is attached to the pub, which may not suit everyone. We liked the pub and had a great meal there. In the summer it would be great with the outside area and the pools. It was too cold for us this time unfortunately. This would encourage us to at least stop in again in the summer.
As for the campground, this was a basic unsheltered mostly patch of dirt. The unpowered sites were cheap so we weren't too fussed about the looks of the place. Unfortunately there was no handy camp kitchen. The BBQ areas only had cold water for dishes and you had to pay to use the BBQS. We hadn't seen that at a paid site before. We usually expect at least a free camp kitchen. We did put our money in on one night to do steaks but it turned off well before our food was cooked and we ended up cooking in our van in the end. A waste of money and effort! We don't even like our steaks cooked for long! As for the toilets and showers. It looks at though they were installed within the last few years and that was probably the last clean they had. This area was depressing and filthy. I noticed cleaning equipment sitting outside the block a few times but maybe they were put there by staff who were pretending to management that they had cleaned. When we arrived I had a look into the cubicles and they were horrendous! Every day I had another look to check if things had been cleaned and NO. Before we left, I was so used to seeing this sight that I could describe the mess in detail and was 100% sure nothing had been cleaned. So in general, it was a dirty and depressing place to stay with the only real benefit being the close proximity of the pub. Also, the security gates around the campsite never seemed to be locked at night and we had one of our camping neighbours shooing people away from going through people's things by their vehicles. NOT really safe either!! We're on the road a LOT and this is one of the worst campsites we've come across unfortunately.",2 months ago,14-07-2025,-23.7217119,133.8694017

Fortunately we rang two days ahead (demand is high in June) and got a powered site for 4 nights at an extremely good rate.  The renovated amenity blocks are excellent.  We had nylon matting under our awning so that was great too with regard to minimising grit tracking into the caravan.  Not all sites have this.  There is a cyclone fence separating the site from the Todd River and there is heavy security on site as it is in the back yard of the Gap View Hotel.     The view to the range is lovely, it is very close to Heavitree Gap and the park is a couple of kilometres south of the city centre.   The pub has a renovated outdoor entertainment area and you can hear what is being shown in the food and drink area.  There are a generous number of BBQ areas for such a small campground and the laundry facilities are also excellent.

The trail takes about 1 hour one way but the problem is your car will be left behind so you need to walk back unless you have other arrangements.

Place is stunning as all parks seen to be in Australia. So much scenery to take on and not enough time. There is a toilet at each of the gap car parks but best only used if you are desperate.

If not walking the long trail you can drive to both gaps see them in about 15mins at each one.

Well worth the drive but more so if you combine it with other trips such as Ellery Creek, etc.

ChIJ16udzZ4ZMisR96MgCm_cCQ4,Pizza Hut Alice Springs,Alice_Springs,Kelly Ryan,1,"If we could give this a minus we would, and very angry and upset and poor treatment. My family had no alternative but to order elsewhere, so it became a VERY expensive and disappointing meal after a difficult day which was meant to be an easy night.

Pizza was 4 hours late!! Yes, 4 hours, ordered at 7.15pm and delivered finally at 11.14pm.

Over 14 calls with the store after 2 hours, spoke to the Indian Manager, Cooinda (Unsure of spelling) on 2 occasions 1 hours apart, and he outright lied to us both times.

Offered us half price back and was going to put them in the oven and deliver immediately himself. Outright lie, on a call in another HOUR, his young employee admitted our order was not yet cooked.
Food arrived after 11 pm by young women who had been called in to support overdue deliveries. They were very much put on the spot and we felt sorry for them having to face multiple very unhappy customers.

Food was undercooked, dough was raw and UNSAFE for human consumption, we had to try to cook it ourselves to make it edible.

Food was incomplete, missing drinks and sides ordered.

Manager refused to speak to me after lying to me, confirmed by his young lovely staff (confirmed that indeed the order had NOT been cooked as promised an hour earlier when already 3 hours late).

No disrespect to the staff who are obviously working for an incompetent manager who lies and then leaves young inexperienced staff to face the music of upset and angry customers. We do not blame any of them at all.

Please Pizza hut either get a decent manager on board and work this out or don't offer delivery, this is the THIRD time of orders not received and store not answering over the last year but in a small town with limited options we decided to try again.

This will be the LAST time for our family or businesses to order from you.

Extremely disappointing and downright dangerous serving undercooked and unsafe food to people.

Also, never received the partial refund we were promised, even the dog couldn't eat this, we request a full refund.

First off: as soon as I got there he was smoking literally infront the door of the shop.

2nd and the most important thing of all, I orderd a peri-peri chicken and I watch him come inside after smoking, used his fingers to put out the ciggarette and proceeded to cook the chicken without washing his hands.

3rd he literally put the chicken for a minute on a grill... I understand the chicken has already been cooked and just needs a little warm up but I'm guessing something on his phone was more important than properly reheating that chicken.

I dont make complains or make bad reviews about restaurants or fast food but this issue I witnessed tonight literally is concerning!

I did not want to accept the chicken he cooked for me but I dont also like wasting food. So I took it and pre warned the staff that was working there about washing his hands after smoking ciggarettes and the chicken... I gave it away...",a year ago,23-02-2024,-23.6989663,133.8796803

Recommendations:
*3 x food drops
*filter your water at each trail head
*don’t use camelbak type water bladders as your only water storage
*share your load around a group
*is the Helinox chair really worth the weight?
*Strive food (Tasmanian Dehydrated Trail food manufacturer) is A+ grade food that tastes delicious
*plan to sleep at the top of mountain tops instead of the trail heads. Trust me you’ll want those sunsets and sunsets. This will mean some short or  some long days. Plan well.
*get your dry pack weight down as low as your budget allows
*I wore a LS Sun hoodie shirt, 5.11 trousers and Salomon boots but admitted you could get away very sturdy high quality trail shoes and lighter clothing (w/ sun screen and insect repellent then more needed)
*a pair of high gaiters are only needed in a section or 2 at most. The track was cut back by workers in most sections when I walked it.
*no the 2 cafes along the way can not be relied upon to resupply and of the typical ‘through hikers’ gear/food needs.
*high water and electrolytes intake. I routinely carried 5L at the start of a trail head (sleep on a mountain, hike the next day to a trail head for water resupply, carry on.
*I was forced into the water on the trail in the Thorntons Gap area for water crossing. It was a high rainfall year this year it looked and there’s no way around it. Oh and the water is like ice!
*if you have camp shoes make it camp shoes that allow you to wear your socks still (oh you’ll want night time socks because it’s so cold…. And your feet likely stink)
*unless you’re okay with getting in the ice cold water holes along the trail you’ll only have 2 chances of a hot shower through all 230+km of the trail.
*follow the blue triangles (I didn’t need a map the whole way, you’ll be fine)
*it can get really lonely walking alone.
*best hike in Australia!",2 years ago,09-09-2023,-23.6551735,133.8277707

The gallery caters to all budgets and offers a wide range of pieces in different sizes, but what really stood out was the uniqueness and authenticity of the artwork. Each piece felt deeply meaningful and inspiring, leaving us with a lasting impression.

The staff were outstanding—knowledgeable, passionate, and truly in tune with the artists’ visions. They helped us understand and appreciate the stories behind the artworks, which made the experience even more special.

Check-in was efficient and friendly.  The snack pack (a muffin, a biscuit, a mandarin and water bottle) was exactly what was needed to keep us sustained until lunchtime.

The crew were outstanding.  The commentary by our principal guide, Landon, provided a wealth of information about the geological history of the gorge, the first nations peoples' Dreaming narrative, historical events during the era of Western exploration, and current management of the ecosystem.  He was very engaged and fun to listen to.

The views all the way along the gorges were breathtaking.  The occasional sighting of a freshie (freshwater crocodile) resting on the bank or on a rock added to the experience.

The chance to have a swim in a waterhole, separated from the main gorge and fed by a waterfall, was an absolute treat.  We're so glad we did it.

It can get crowded on the weekends, but if you take the 11am ferry in and wait until after the return trip at 12:30pm, you may have the entire swimming hole to yourself (and then just hike back).

ChIJ6Vz0A7m_uiwRG_4kiczhPLo,Red Rooster Katherine,Katherine,Dawie van der Merwe,1,"Absolutely shocking experience. This was hands down the worst attitude I’ve ever encountered in any restaurant — anywhere in all my life.

My wife was blatantly disrespected twice by a staff member named Edna. The first time was simply for sitting at a table that was ""apparently"" for staff but not marked as such, second time for asking if someone could clean a table as they were all dirty with food markings on the tables — a basic, reasonable request. Edna responded with an aggressive tone, a hostile attitude, and a stare that made my wife feel incredibly uncomfortable — as if she had no right to even ask.

We had already paid for our food, but because of Edna’s repeated disrespect, we decided to cancel our order and requested a refund — which we were given.

To be clear, we had originally returned to Red Rooster because of a fantastic experience with a young woman named Leeta earlier in the day. She was warm, kind, and welcoming — a true asset to your team. But Edna’s behavior completely erased that goodwill.

When I calmly asked Edna why she had spoken to my wife that way, her only reply was, “That’s how I speak to everyone.”

To the owner or manager: If that’s the standard your staff are allowed to uphold, you won’t see returning customers. A business is only as good as the people representing it at the front. Right now, that representation is a problem due to Edna.",4 months ago,04-06-2025,-14.4640676,132.2621176

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed and made to feel at home. The staff were incredibly friendly, attentive, and went out of their way to make sure our stay was comfortable.

The rooms were spotless, spacious, and well-maintained, with everything we needed for a relaxing stay. The beds were comfortable, the air-conditioning worked perfectly (a must in Katherine), and the little touches like fresh linens and toiletries made it feel extra welcoming.

The location is excellent close to the town centre but still peaceful and quiet, with easy access to local attractions and the beautiful Katherine River. The property has a tropical, relaxed vibe that makes you feel like you’re on holiday the moment you step in.

What stood out the most was the atmosphere  calm, clean, and family-friendly, with great facilities and plenty of space to unwind. It’s clear the owners and staff put genuine care into keeping the hotel well looked after.

Overall, we couldn’t have asked for a better stay. Highly recommend the Tropical River Hotel to anyone visiting Katherine – whether it’s for a quick stopover or a longer trip, you’ll be well looked after here. We’ll definitely be coming back ❤️",a month ago,18-08-2025,-14.4557422,132.268664

In Sydney this may not have earned four stars but it's definitely a cut above other restaurants we've eaten in over the last week. I enjoyed my beef strip loin salad.

Wow – just wow! One of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had.

We started with the calamari fritti, which simply melted in our mouths and set the tone for an incredible night. For mains, my wife had the pork belly – absolutely mind-blowing, rich, tender, and perfectly paired with a five-spice fruity sauce. I went with the 350g scotch fillet, cooked to absolute perfection. Both dishes were outstanding.

Even though we were full, we couldn’t resist dessert – and I’m glad we didn’t! I had the Golden Plate award-winning passionfruit curd tart (a true standout) while my wife enjoyed the indulgent chocolate fondant. Both were unforgettable.

The cocktails topped it all off beautifully, the service was spot on, and the atmosphere was just perfect.

ChIJHbAbl4y_uiwRzS7Bv2Nj9l8,Banjo Bar & Terrace,Katherine,Audrey,1,"We have stayed at the contour hotel previously and not overly impressed (see separate review) We tried to dine at Banjo’s due to the rave reviews, but there was a wedding on.  This time, we booked to stay at Contour specifically so we could try the restaurant. I booked the restaurant online and received a confirmation and was asked to confirm a few days prior to arrival.

Upon arrival, no booking in the system 🤦‍♀️. We were able to be accommodated inside because it was very quiet.

We ordered the pork belly and the fish curry.  At $42 and $44 you have expectations and these dishes did not come close to meeting them.  The meals were so bad we are thinking the reviews must be fake haha.

The pork belly with soy sauce was so salty it was inedible.  The feedback from the kitchen after they tried it - agreed.

The fish curry lacked appeal in presentation. The three prawns were small and most likely from a frozen packet (I’ve bought exact same from Woolies) and the barramundi although a decent size was thick. Not light and easy to slice a fork through. The sauce although tasty had the general smell of off milk.

I don’t know if the chef is on holiday or they have had a change of staff, but the meals were so disappointing , it doesn’t match with what we have read.

The flies are also very bad inside, you are constantly shooing them away.

One of us is now currently incapacitated in the bathroom (the pork meal) and I have stomach cramps so hopefully I don’t have to update this review with food poisoning.

ChIJVfWPzVi-uiwR2vDA-tHxdts,Contour Hotel Katherine,Katherine,Audrey,3,"I typically post after we leave accommodation, but specifically disappointed in this one.

Firstly I had to wait in reception for quite awhile - this was around 4pm. There was a staff member on their computer in a room to the left in reception but they didn’t acknowledge me or say someone was coming to assist.

We booked based on the rave reviews of the restaurant. Unfortunate timing for us as there was a wedding taking place the following day and two coach loads of older individuals. We couldn’t get near the restaurant :(. We had to order from literally the only Indian restaurant that would deliver in Katherine. And that was average btw.

The location is just out of town. Which made us feel ‘safer’ and it is gated. Large manicured grounds, very tidy and nice trees/lawn. A lot bigger than we expected, there are multiple options for accommodation inc caravans with ensuite cabins.

Motel style - park in front of your room. We stayed in a deluxe room. This is not deluxe at all, very dated. It hasn’t been updated since the 80’s. It was passable clean. Our neighbors tried to open their back sliding door and it fell off 🤦‍♀️😅 I wouldn’t expect to pay more than $150 a night - $235 was very overpriced.  And then you have the neighboring houses where dogs constantly bark.

Overall, a very disappointing experience. Won’t stay here again. Will try to give Katherine a miss!",3 months ago,20-06-2025,-14.4716385,132.2903307

The only thing I enjoyed was my cold can of Fanta. The bundle price is great but to you’ll get what you paid for...

Absolutely excellent experience at the Katherine Club! From the moment we walked in, we were warmly welcomed at reception. The staff were more than willing to explain how everything works, and their friendliness stood out from the start.

I asked could I see before committing, the manager happily agreed to me even trying with the van before taking my money. Much appreciated too.

I got the van in, so all was good. She even gave me a 7 day discount, even though they normally don't. Saved a few $$$

Great park, great management, very friendly and helpful. Sites are angled for easy exit, and concrete for van and vehicle, and awning, can't ask for better.

Amenities were clean and tidy.
Large camp kitchen, big tv, everything you'd need. Tables and bench seats plentiful.

You can tell there is excellent management here with high standards as the whole park is immaculately presented.

It was busy but there were always showers and toilets available and they were spotlessly clean.

We were tent peasants for this trip and had a lovely shady generous size site 52. Very close to the amenities. There are lots of trees and palms. The front section has some pretty fancy cabins overlooking the new pool.

There are two pools, laundry with dryers and a decent amount of clotheslines, kitchen with sinks, microwave, kettle and gas burner as well as hot plates.  Everything you need.

They also had some activities such as Friday sausage sizzle which was a $2 donation and Sunday the same for pancakes.

ChIJO9vCHjmauiwRHyvIu0PLJD4,Nitmiluk Gorge Caravan Park,Katherine,Eric Tollemer,3,"We stayed two nights at Nitmiluk Camp with our camper van on a powered site.

The location is fantastic—right in the gorge area, with walking access to a beautiful lookout and the starting point for the boat tours. The visitor centre is large and well-maintained, serving good food and offering decent Wi-Fi.

However, the powered sites are quite cramped—just enough room to park the camper and squeeze in a table and chairs. It’s a bit disappointing to be in the vast outback and still hear your neighbour flushing the toilet. Speaking of which, the shared toilets were clean but underwhelming: too few for the number of guests, and some had broken locks. They really feel in need of an update.

ChIJDYQJ8La_uiwRajDM0gkEQ4g,Beagle Hotel,Katherine,Barbara M,2,"I would like this review to be helpful to the Jawoyn Assoc. The same Assoc that runs the Nitmiluk Gorge Cruises & associated activities in such a professional, safe & seamless manner. The Beagle should be the Motel of choice for anyone who has experienced Nitmiluk. But sadly, it doesn't match that standard.
We had a ""Superior Queen"" room, which stated it's a comfortable room for two people. We paid over $200 for this.
What was delivered was a room nowhere near Superior.
For two people there was;
1 glass
1 bedside table
1 chair
No bedside lamps
No towel rails or even hooks in the bathroom.
The small electric jug leaked water over the bench.

The lino floor had holes in it. The venetian blind didn't shut properly. The curtains over it were see through (see photos) The light outside was on all night, so our room was bright. Sleep was difficult. And I did not undress or dress in the room as anyone walking past could see into the room. A huge gap under the door welcomed in the bugs.
The area behind the front door, which can't be seen when it's open, was filthy.
The experience was very unpleasant.

I've read the reviews & I'm not the only one pointing out issues. The Management responds with phrases like ""We will keep this in mind for future improvements""
""Genuinely sorry your stay did not meet your expectations""
""Not a standard we aim to uphold""

Please Jawoyn Assoc, a few hundred dollars can fix a lot of these problems. It's not an expensive fix to add hooks in the bathroom, another side table, another chair, drinking water glasses, table lamps. Block out curtains.And clean behind doors.",2 weeks ago,18-09-2025,-14.462628,132.2684

Not only did the housekeeper knock on my door and wake me up at 8:30am, despite check-out being at 10am, but she also came back around 9:30am, knocked once and immediately opened the door while I was still in bed. That’s incredibly disrespectful and intrusive.

On top of that, it’s simply impossible to sleep in the morning: there’s a jigsaw saw being used right next to the rooms, and some people gather outside the bedrooms, laughing and speaking loudly, as if no guests were trying to rest.

I did notice some improvements, such as the installation of a smart TV, new outdoor furniture, and better bedding, which shows that some effort has been made. But unfortunately, these positives were overshadowed by the lack of respect for guests’ comfort.

To make matters worse, I also found three cockroaches in my room.",2 months ago,11-07-2025,-14.462628,132.2684

They went above and beyond, even generously giving us a lift to and from our dinner cruise since we couldn’t drive the hire car after sunset, which we were so grateful for.
We stayed in the glamping tent (mid-August) and absolutely loved it. The bed was so comfy, and with the perfect night temperatures, we didn’t need the A/C. The shared kitchen was well-equipped with everything we could possibly need, and the pool was the perfect spot to cool off and relax in the afternoons.
A highlight was the sunset pizza, an absolute must if it’s on during your stay! The pizzas were delicious, the views over the valley at sunset were breathtaking, and Kate’s cocktails were the perfect finishing touch. Highly recommend!",a month ago,22-08-2025,-14.3867302,132.4084942

The kitchen itself was clean, well-equipped with plenty of utensils, and even stocked with a few basic ingredients in case you forget something. The toilets, laundry area, and swimming facilities were all clean and well maintained.

The safari-style accommodation looked amazing we’ll definitely consider trying that next time. There’s also a viewing deck with a stunning sunset view, although we unfortunately missed it. It would’ve been helpful to have a map of the facilities to get around more easily.

However, there were two supposed helpers sitting outside at the tables. These two women ,both younger than the ladies serving, were quite rude and arrogant.
One in particular who started putting away some chairs while our children and I were looking through the old building and relics was very rude.

We were near the entrance of the building when she came over with two folded chairs,  I apologised for our perhaps being in the road and asked if she wished to come through.
The answer was a curt NO, with a very unpleasant look on her face.

This turned what was a nice experience into a not so nice experience. These sort of biased, judgemental persons should not be volunteers.

The place itself has a decent garden around it with nice shaded sitting area.

I've been here twice to buy hot chips (which they cook amazingly) but everytime I kick myself why do I bother coming back. The lady wants to give you what she wants to give you even though you request for the hot chips to be taken from the freshly cooked pile.

I believe what the other reviewer stated about the prices are exorbitant and one can't even engage in a decent dialogue with her (the other reviewer stated she was waved the receipt at her etc..) and she doesn't quite know how to answer challenging questions/questions outside of the status quo (not to her liking), whilst maintaining good customer service

ChIJF0V5_vRMTCsRA_BecSX9fdw,Sporties Club,Tennant_Creek,Masoud Dehghan,4,"Sporties Club in Tennant Creek is a standout for hearty, satisfying meals without breaking the bank. The food, especially given the remote setting, is excellent. Portions are generously sized, so you definitely get good value for your money. The menu offers a surprising variety, from grilled steaks and prawn linguine to modern Australian dishes and even themed nights like Asian or Italian, all prepared with fresh ingredients.

For Tennant Creek, it’s uncommon to find such quality and portion sizes at moderate prices, and Sporties delivers consistently. The atmosphere is laid-back and welcoming, perfect for a relaxed dinner with friends or family.

That said, there is a bit of a trade-off. On occasion, you might notice some domestic issues or raised voices just outside the premises. While it doesn’t happen often and doesn’t generally spill into the dining space, it can be a distraction during quieter moments.

Overall, Sporties Club feels like a gem in Tennant Creek, solid food quality, big servings, fair prices, and a casual, friendly vibe.

ChIJc21dPPNMTCsRQLH-G6kXAh0,Tennant Creek Caravan Park,Tennant_Creek,Mark Blackburn,5,"Big Thanks to Tennant Creek Caravan Park & Kylie

After nine days in Tennant Creek, we want to give a special shout-out to Kylie and the team at the Tennant Creek Caravan Park. Kylie was absolutely fantastic—always friendly, smiling, and genuinely helpful. She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed, and her effort didn’t go unnoticed.

The pool was a real highlight—perfect for cooling off in the afternoons, always clean and refreshing. There’s a cleaner who comes through daily, keeping the amenities fresh, which made a big difference during our extended stay. Yes, its a little dated, but this is an outback town with limited resources, if you want a 5* hotel, stay on the Gold cost for ten times the price.

It’s easy to overlook places like this when you’re just passing through, but we’re grateful for the comfort, care, and kindness we experienced here. We’d happily stay again and highly recommend it to anyone coming through Tennant Creek.

The town gets alot of negative press, but for the 9 nights we stayed here, I went running everyday, everywhere, and no one bothered me. We didn't see anyone jumping the fence or steeling (we took our things inside at night) theres a little noise out in the street but that can't be helped. Just ask to stay away from the road.

Thanks again, Kylie—you’re doing a brilliant job.",2 weeks ago,15-09-2025,-19.6384977,134.1922285

Cars screaming up & down the road, doing burnouts. People yelling, screaming & fighting… even little kids were getting in on the action! All quietened down around midnight.

The website doesn't reflect the actual current conditions of the total park, it is very misleading.

We stayed on a powered site, there was no where to place the water hose which caused excess moisture around our caravan.
There is NO DUMP POINT, if you are paying to stay, then regardless a Dump Point should be provided.

The tap fixtures need some work due to being rundown and cross threading.
As the grounds are very unkempt, the trees and shrubs need much needed pruning.
The laundry washing machine and dryers are old and mostly broken, they need some much needed TLC.

She was dismissive of questions re the police in the park, asking us how she was supposed to know what's going on and then proceeding to blame us for accidentally leaving a few things outside, stating ""because of us they'd come back again"" News flash lady, it's your park and a walk of the boundary would tell you all you need to know.

Little touches like mints on the bed, cold water in the fridge & biscuits with the tea & coffee in the room was also a nice touch.

This roadhouse provides a great selection of meals, great pet and kid friendly cabins which are clean, functional and quiet and overall we felt incredibly safe in the remote NT Outback.
Obviously being this remote comes at price, but you cannot put a price on safety, security and convenience. As a solo traveller, having a good nights rest between two long legs and ensuring the security of my car were of upmost importance.
I paid $145 for a cabin with two dogs, lunch has a cheaper menu which lasts until 5:30pm, dinner ranges from $23-40 but all meals were large and looked delicious.

Unfortunately this time the two female staff at the counter had a terrible attitude and put a bad taste in my mouth.. They spoke to us as if we we had stolen their dog and tripped over their nan, they we're incredibly rude.

Lots of short walks down to the river (with day visit parking) means that you have your own secluded spot to swim/chill. Even though it was high season (dry season) and a weekend! (We put our camp chairs in the water, sat and chilled all afternoon).

Visit to camp or for a day trip. The road to Latram was easy (you do not need a 4WD). For Goanna Lagoon you will need a 4WD as there is a steep water crossing.

Crystal clear, warm water, soft white sand & not too many people around—just a few 4WDs parked up on the beach like us. It’s safe to swim - but as with all bodies of water here in East Arnhem Land. you do have to keep a look out 🐊 👀

It’s about 40km out of Nhulunbuy & the track in gets sandy at the end, so you’ll want to be in a proper 4WD & know how to handle the soft stuff: aka, drop the tyres. It wasn’t as boggy as we had been led to believe but it was a bit tight! We have a few new pinstripes now, but nothing that won’t buff out 😁

We didn’t camp, but you can—there’s even a composting loo tucked away near the back.

An amazing location with beach stretching over a kilometres. It is actually one of 3 beaches and is named after it's location (in the middle).
There is a small car park area, fenced to protect the wildlife and environment.

Clearly posted is the walkway down onto the beach. You can dip your toes in the water as you stroll along, but swimming is not recommended. This is due to crocodiles and box jellyfish.
The scenery is calming and peaceful.
A wonderful beach to take your children to play on the sand or simply sit and watch a sunset.

At various times there will be a fish & chip mobile van available, usually early evening, but no set days.

ChIJxSw2aByB3WkRzWbK6aXdfjg,Cape Wirrawoi (Wirrwawuy),Nhulunbuy,Aneka Truman,5,"Our favourite campsite on our trip to Nhulunbuy, and one of the best we have stayed at in the NT!

Beautiful location, great and fun drive in along the dunes and beaches (need a 4WD), limited number of people (you need a permit for camping or day use).

Explore a variety of the beaches; Oyster Beach, Cave Beach (these are a right turn, campground is a left turn up the small peninsula) and those you drive along to access the campsites.

All of the campsites are large and secluded from each other (3 and 4 are the closest together, you can see the other campsite). We stayed at Campsite 4 and loved the view.

We were told that Campsite 3 was the penthouse with the best views (it is next to Campsite 4, on the corner with views over both beaches), but Campsite 4 goes right down to the beach (Campsite 3 is consistently higher up); we would choose Campsite 4 again in the future.

There are wooden poles across the front of the campsites, on Campsite 4 we were able to drive our Prado in-between two poles; this allowed us to put up our shade for the few days we camped here, and gave us privacy from Campsite 3.

This is an incredible spot! The views are phenomenal. Camp for a few days and relax, walk along the beaches, fish, explore the 4WD tracks, swim in the shallows (the water is so clear). Such a beautiful place.

Please spare the time to collect some rubbish on your trip, due to the wind the beaches collect a lot of rubbish, the rangers work hard to clean up, but the little we can do will help.",2 years ago,26-06-2023,-12.1611093,136.780389

On Sunday, 6th July 2025, I dined at your establishment and was overcharged by $80. Unfortunately, this overcharge went unnoticed until the following day. Upon realising the error, I phoned the tavern and spoke with an employee, who assured me they would follow up. However, I did not receive a return call.

I then visited the tavern in person and spoke to the manager, who stated they could not assist me at that time but took my bank account details and assured me that the matter would be rectified as soon as the accounts team were in the following day. Despite this reassurance, I have yet to receive a reimbursement.

Since then, I have made three additional phone calls, each time being told that the manager would return my call — a promise that has not been fulfilled. I am now home from my holiday and still out of pocket by $80, with no resolution in sight.

Well, after and hours sleep all night due to the yelling and traffic it isn’t quiet. I asked her on the map where are the toilets and showers, she didn’t know and couldn’t show me. After a walk up town we found the shower block, but they were all locked up and no one around to unlock it.
So no showers, no toilet - had to pee on the grass, no laundry facilities and no bin in the camping area.
Def don’t recommend this place for a $65 piece of grass.
Left at daylight as we felt unsafe, don’t recommend at all and won’t be back !!",4 months ago,23-05-2025,-12.1851156,136.788245

ChIJn8KKOIl1tywRSG3ouzEfmUU,Anbangbang Rock Shelter,Jabiru,The Melbie,5,"Excellent background history of Kakadu's indigenous history & traditions as part of day tour from Darwin. Info boards give limited spiel - certainly not in detail why one artwork is not to be photographed & shared online. Visited on Sat 26/7/25 in Kakadu's even more hot & humid conditions. A Kakadu National Park's pass is needed to enter the area but included in our AAT King Tour. Toilets are located here at main parking area.

The scenery along Arnhem Highway was parched & dry - populated with pandanus spiky trees & smaller native vegetation except for wreaths of wetlands that passed all too quickly. Insect repellant advisable & stay hydrated esp. at this time of year.

For goodness sake, if you are on meds, skip brekkie & think foolishly that bcos you were a fit hiker 20 years ago, you can do the uphill walk - under 1 km loop it may be. Do not underestimate the toll the Kakadu heat & humidity will do to you even for a short distance. 2 options - take either the unsealed, uneven incline walk with steps to get to the first rock shelter with ancient & recent aboriginal artwork or take the flat paved route to the lower & main rock art area.

An over 80s male in our group did not heed the advice & had a near collapse up at the 1st rock shelter. Timely first aid by guide & attendees revived him but overall set us back by half an hour. We then had to curtail the rest of tour stops to make up time. So please know your limits.

We booked it very last minute (the same day!) after seeing it on Google maps.
We’re on a small budget so usually wouldn’t spend $500 (for 2 of us) so casually, but we really wanted a cultural experience while in kakadu.
Often when you’re spending a larger sum of money on a things like this, you can feel worried that it might not end up being worth it, but let me tell you that this tour was 100% worth it.
Sean had so much knowledge that he shared with us throughout the day and it was really special to be shown the traditional ways of food gathering & cooking etc by Patsy.
We loved being out in the bush, learning new things and enjoying the natural world and traditional ways of life.
During the tour we saw crocs, buffalo, dingos, a black headed python and many beautiful birds.
The meal cooked at the end during sunset was absolutely incredible.

ChIJRf-eV0XVuSwRbzdCRa8Tysg,Animal Tracks Safari,Jabiru,Franco Colzi,5,"I went on a bush tour with Patsy and Don and honestly, it was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had.
Patsy is a real Aboriginal woman who somehow manages to bring you closer to the culture of a fascinating people. Don is super enthusiastic and passionate about his job, and throughout the whole trip he never stopped sharing really interesting info.
During the tour, we got to try out some unique flavors and scents from the land—digging up shellfish, tasting edible berries, smelling the strong aroma of green ants (and even trying their surprisingly delicate flavor). We also spotted a few animals along the way—buffalo, dingoes, and lots of amazing birds.
When we arrived at this little slice of paradise in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by thousands of birds, a traditional fire was set up. We cooked what we had collected plus some meat (buffalo and birds) brought along for the occasion. Don even baked damper, a kind of traditional bread.
I highly recommend this experience. I’m sure you’ll find other similar tours, but I honestly doubt you’ll meet someone like Don, who puts such incredible passion into his work. When you join, you’ll realize you’re not treated like just another tourist who paid a ticket, but as someone genuinely interested in learning the ways and traditions of the local Indigenous people.",3 weeks ago,10-09-2025,-12.9055931,132.5216555

The Skipper cum guide was excellent (did not get his name, sorry!) - gently swinging the boat around, so both sides got a turn to view the billabong's star attractions. Midway, he switched off the engines & allowed us to listen to the sounds of saltmarsh which was contemplative & tranquil. He was amusing, knowledgeable & imparted enough info without overwhelming.

Apart from the Crocs, the birdlife is numerous. Watch the cutesy flitting of the pink crested Jacana & his little ones on the lilly pads, blue kingfisher darting in & out of the water, Darters drying their wings, tons of whistling ducks, elegant Jabirus, multitude of herons & some birds of prey flying overhead. Feral brumbies & introduced species also call this home & cannot be totally eradicated unfortunately.

Just wished that I could stay longer to do both the sunrise & sunset cruise. There's plenty of cold water onboard to keep hydrated - stiflingly hot & humid.

Stepping onto Arnhem Land for the lookout was both unique and uplifting, as was the spear-throwing demonstration.

The first half hour of the tour was focused on crocodile spotting at Cahills Crossing (downstream). We found this redundant, as there was no added value in seeing it from the boat—visiting the platform gives the same experience. Cruising upstream was far more interesting.

We made occasional stops to look at trees and animals, but for us, most of this was already familiar. The boat has no speakers, so the cruise was mostly silent. This quiet time could easily be filled with what the tour lacked—more cultural sharing.

We had hoped for deeper insights into the people who lived here: their spiritual beliefs, laws, and way of life, not just practical aspects like hunting.

It wouldn’t take much to upgrade the experience: a basic speaker system and a stronger focus on cultural knowledge would transform the tour.",3 weeks ago,11-09-2025,-12.4295149,132.9674418

All the food came in generous portions. House brisket was dry and tough. The sauce couldn't rescue it. Comes only with mash. Rump was chewey. Shame as the quality seemed good. Veg was cold. Both disappointing. Pizzas are good and big. The kangaroo is pretty good, steamed veg varied from nice to hard, uncooked and barely luke warm. Can't figure this. The prawn pasta is generous and nice.

ChIJfVVVVVXFuSwRKpQXINb_mR0,Mimi's Restaurant,Jabiru,神秘的小花,2,"This is my first negative comment and hopefully my last one. I tried not to leave negative comments even when I don’t like the food. As I think it’s unfair to judge when everyone has individually different tastes. But I feel I have to put this one here so no more vegan people would have similar experience as I had tonight.

$42 roasted eggplant is not worth it.
I was excited about the $42 eggplant would be exceptional but…
Mine was too salty and overcooked.
Eggplant literally tasted like salt with the burnt eggplant charcoal covered. The sauces around it made the dish looked expensive but it was very difficult to taste anything good when the eggplant was that salty.

I told one of the staff that the eggplant is too salty and burnt. But she said it’s normal colour when it’s grilled. Ok, either her eggplant is always burnt or I misunderstood the $42 doesn’t mean high standards? She should argue with customers after she actually tasted it herself so she was not prejudging my experience, or customer’s’ experience. She said she will let the chef know.

I don’t know if I care or not chef does or doesn’t know the eggplant is overcooked and over-salted. But I came here to spend $42 to learn that maybe I should’ve never attempted to spend $42 for roasted eggplant! Hopefully my sacrifice will save someone else’s money and a peaceful night.

Suggestions:
Go to the shop and get Mi goreng instant noodles with a can of chickpeas. Put chickpeas together with the noodles and it tastes alright if you have hungry vegan stomach. It’ve got your proteins as well! 😉

P.S. if you read till this bit and not a vegan, I cannot tell you what their other food is like. Sorry! But definitely any food would be better than the $42 roasted eggplant so just don’t be a fool like me thinks the$42 roasted eggplant will be special.",6 months ago,31-03-2025,-12.9058,132.5214097

ChIJfVVVVVXFuSwRKpQXINb_mR0,Mimi's Restaurant,Jabiru,Daniel Arndt,5,"If you're staying at the Cooinda Lodge then this is your only dining option, apart from the alfresco Barra Bar. In saying that this is a great dining option - was not expecting such a refined dining experience in Kakadu. We had dinner there twice, so we got to go through most of the dishes on the menu. We also had our breakfasts there.

In the evening the restaurant is open between 6 and 8:30pm, so at peak times it is worth making a booking (noting that they can't be done online).  It is enclosed and air-conditioned so makes for a comfortable dining experience. The a-la carte menu includes full table service by staff who understand proper customer service.  The food is top notch, great local produce such as barramundi and buffalo perfectly prepared, creatively incorporating native ingredients (such as native lemon grass, melaleuca or paperbark leaves, bush tomatoes, salt bush, native thyme, native river mint, finger limes, Illawarra plum, and Kakadu plum).  I totally recommend trying the Barramundi Crudo, the Prawn and Crab Risotto and the Marinated Rum Jungle Buffalo Fillet, washed down with either an Australian red wine or a refreshing local beer. The creativity and ingenuity of the chefs is to be applauded the use of Australian bush food elevates each of the dishes. I also read that they employ local indigenous chef's apprentices, which definitely reflects in the uniqueness of all their food.

Buffet-style breakfasts are served between 6:30 and 10:00 am - generally no need to book but I would suggest that you time your breakfast to avoid when all the tourists are finishing their Yellow River cruise as it gets very busy. There was a reasonable selection of cereals, toast, fruits, pastries and full hot breakfast with bacon, poached and scrambled eggs, baked beans, and hash browns etc. I loved the juice machines - nothing like freshly squeezed orange juice or if you want coffee, they have a great Nespresso machine for guests to use.

We were both impressed by Mimi's restaurant, it certainly wasn't what we expected and if you want to sample Australian bushfoods in delicious dishes then it is a perfect introduction to the uninitiated.",2 months ago,29-07-2025,-12.9058,132.5214097

At this stage I had to go back up, tell them I wanted my meal, to again the waitress replied I’ll see where it is. Some time after that my meal finally arrived, they had already cleared the table of entree and my wife’s main. Some time later a waiter then apologized for the meal.

The most important part of any travel that includes driving is good quality SLEEP. That you will not have at Kakadu Lodge if you are paying for a cabin. It was as if someone shoved 6 springs into a shelled out mattress and called it a day. It wouldn’t have been so bad if you didn’t have to pay over $700.00 for two  nights. The food is really average but the prices are not! They are running a top tier scam, all we have are our memories and these memories are below average. The takeaway alcohol is bizzare. They provide you with an alcohol pass per adult but you can only purchase either a bottle of wine or a 6 pack per accomodation building…… also disappointing that they put no effort into telling their guests “ hey yeh you know how you’ve driven a couple of hours to get here, so you can explore some water falls.

Info on camp website says ""4wd recommended"" but not required, few sandy patches on the track in but my 2wd rwd van made it in on a dry track and made it out (after assessing the track on foot...) after an overnight downpour. I would say 2wd with average clearance is fine in dry weather, there's only less than 1km of track that is a bit tricky for 2wd, the rest is well maintained.

Note that the access road is quite sandy for a few hundred metres at its midpoint: I struggled to traverse this on a motorbike, but 4WD's had little problem.

On the plus side, we had a spacious powered site within a reasonable distance of the amenities. The restaurant was pleasant, and the on-site store was well stocked, with friendly and helpful staff. The common kitchen was clean and spacious.

However, the toilets were very basic and could use an upgrade, and the Wi-Fi at the main centre barely worked during our stay—which was frustrating given the price point.

We did take the two-hour Yellow Water boat cruise and highly recommend it. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable, and we saw a wide variety of wildlife—definitely the highlight of our time there.",3 months ago,15-06-2025,-12.9050481,132.5216561

Well no 1 is probably the smallest site I’ve ever seen and it was dirt and leaves - the map is not in proportion. So that was annoying.  It’s also right on the bend of the road. Had a little bit of shade which was something.  Camp is quiet.

Camp kitchen is very close to site 1 - as well as the amenities block and laundry. Laundry is $4 a load.  Buy the detergent from onsite shop or bring your own. They do have clotheslines if you have pegs or clothes horses chained to the outside verandah.  There is another huge camp kitchen opposite the laundry.

The Amenities - there are two blocks so plenty of showers and toilets if you don’t go at peak hour. They are reasonably surface clean.  Some of the shower heads are terrible and need replacing.

The pools are very nice. There is a main pool including kiddies pool - with shade and grass and a second pool next to restaurant that is a bit quieter.

The Barra Bar does a good pizza! Extremely fast service.

The onsite shop has a very good range of non perishable goods.

Nightly at 1830 there is a huge waft of sewage, there is a sewage point 50m away so try to avoid this site and go as far away as possible :(

The whole set up is great, there are a lot of accommodation and food options. Staff are friendly and helpful and the grounds are well kept.

We booked the Yellow Water River Cruise from here - it was a well organized tour - I did a separate review.

🌄 Uluru – Where the Earth Speaks in Stories
Standing before Uluru (Ayers Rock), my husband and I were absolutely in awe — not just by its sheer size or its striking red glow at sunset, but by the deep, spiritual presence it holds. 💫
This UNESCO World Heritage site isn’t just a rock — it's a sacred site for the Anangu people, rich with ancient stories passed down through generations. Stories that teach, inspire, and guide — serving as role models for those yet to come.
💬 Every crevice, every color shift tells a tale.
And let’s be honest... photos don’t do it justice — you feel Uluru more than you see it.

Only minor things that prevented a 5 star review and that is that our room didn't have a window as such because the windows were in the bathroom, just seems like odd design more than anything but made the room less pleasant to spend time in. And the other minor issue was that our room service was missed one day.

I’ll start with the positives, from our driver/story teller Michael, to the didgeridoo player, the staff, the sunset, canapés were absolutely outstanding. And even though I’m not much of a wine drinker from all reports that was great too.
Unfortunately, not long after being seated, and the sun started to set the wind and cold was hard to deal with, even taking jackets and using the blankets provided. The heaters were not effective at all due to the high wind, our entrees and mains were cold, even though they were bought to the table with a cloche.
Basically unacceptable for a $80 pub feed let alone a $900 per couple. I understand you can’t control the weather but you can control your dining area. The addition of a closed section or even a more effective wind break would’ve made the night enjoyable.
As I said, perfect weather and it would be a big 5 stars, but with the lack of options to suit the weather I wouldn’t recommend people take the chance.

We were really impressed on the first occasion and purchased a lovely piece in the environment where the indigenous artists are actually painting their stories in the gallery.

Gallery staff are really helpful and enthusiastic about the art being created in front of visitors like us, and on this occasion, Adelaide was the gallery assistant who explained the creation stories of Uluru and the Anangu indigenous artists.   Adelaide was a pleasure to deal with, and made our purchase of another artwork really easy, as well as, packing the large canvas securely in a postal tube for air transit back home on our flight and delivering it to our accommodation.    And, it arrived safely in over-sized baggage thanks to her diligence with the packing.

Walkatjara is a not for profit Art Centre owned by the Aboriginal Mutitjulu community.   This gave us confidence and comfort with our purchases and was a reason we went back to this gallery.   You have the opportunity to ask questions and receive insights about the artwork in the place where the artwork was created, as well as, knowing that you are supporting the local indigenous community in this iconic Australian location.

If visiting, take the opportunity to look through the many canvases that are displayed or on tables.   Then try to imagine how the artwork will appear on your wall, once stretched and professionally framed.    Ours look magnificent and we are so happy with our memories that lend the art additional meaning and with the knowledge that we have supported the artists and community.",9 months ago,23-12-2024,-25.3598415,131.0172286

Jaw-dropping and spellbinding, it led us through the Mala story we had just read and experienced through visiting key sites at Uluṟu today.

I highly do not recommend Outback Sky Journeys. This was the only letdown on an otherwise incredible trip to Uluru.

The experience was extremely underwhelming. We were taken to an area just behind the car park in the resort, where passing headlights from vehicles kept flashing directly into our eyes, completely ruining any attempt at proper stargazing. The guide insisted we not use our phones, yet the spot was so poorly chosen and light-polluted that we could barely see anything meaningful in the sky.

The telescope looked outdated, and the objects shown were the same ones clearly visible to the naked eye. No planets, no nebulas, no Milky Way arches — nothing that couldn’t be identified using a free sky app.

The guide mostly pointed at stars and recited basic facts — nothing insightful, and certainly not worth the premium price charged for this experience.

Honestly, it felt like a waste of money and time. For something that’s supposed to be magical and awe-inspiring under Uluru’s skies, this was poorly executed and disappointing from start to finish.",2 months ago,29-07-2025,-25.2413442,130.9834636

Amazing experience. We had originally booked with another local company who called the afternoon before and cancelled our tour based on “engineering” issues. We contacted PHS at the Town Centre Information Centre and were luckily able to get a booking via them at almost the same time we had booked with the other company. We were picked up out front our hotel on time by a super friendly driver (who is also a pilot) and drove us out to the airport for our flight. Was surprised to hear enroute we had the chopper to ourselves (2 of us) so we were even more excited for the private tour. Our pilot (young female) was extremely professional and informative from the moment we boarded the helicopter to the moment we landed. Throughout the flight she also gave us some insights and history on the landscape which was great.

ChIJYRSEq2tBIysRokL39-TvL4o,Professional Helicopter Services | Helicopter Tours Uluru | Uluru Tours | Ayers Rock Helicopter Tours,Yulara_Uluru,Jeff Sereno,5,"Did two helicopter flights with PHS - the Kings Canyon flight, and the Uluru/Kata Tjuta flight, one day apart.

You have several packages to choose from with the cheapest being an 8-minute tour, a 15 minute tour and a 25-30 minute tour. The middle package is typically the most popular because it's not much more expensive than the shortest tour and provides the most satisfying experience overall. Note that each tour time includes the flight time to and from the helipad, but this does not detract from the experience because the taking off and landing while seeing the perspective of where you are from the air in general on its own is a lot of fun as well.

Anyway, I did the 15-minute Kings Canyon flight and this gives you two passes over the canyon itself and two passes over the surrounding area which allows people on both sides of the helicopter have the opportunity to take good photos/videos of everything.

One of the very cool aspects of the flight was that we would do a hard banking turn to flip around so the other side could get photos, and the G-forces associated with that were amazing, plus seeing the horizon flip 70-90 degrees!

For Uluru/Kata Tjuta, we did the 25 minute flight. Again, multiple passes for everyone and a nice hard banking at 180-200km/h for good measure. We also got a good overview of the Ayers Rock Resort and surrounding area.

Throughout the entire experience, the pilot explained everything that was happening, we could hear the calls to the tower so we could understand what the communication process in general was there, we could talk to each other and the pilot (you are muted when the pilot is talking to the tower), and at all times the ride was smooth with no unexpected bumps. We felt completely safe the entire time. Even the landing was A-1 without a single bump - you couldn't feel it!

Booking was effortless, the safety induction was simple and painless, and the crew take care of all aspects of securing you in the helicopter with respect to belting up and so forth.

The entire experience was worth every dollar. I highly recommend it.",4 months ago,18-05-2025,-25.2413108,130.98337

ChIJkyDyCaAhIysRbz-dRAByPPA,Start of Great Central Road,Yulara_Uluru,Michael Cooke,4,"Permits are required to travel on this road:
Tjukaruru Road NT section: https://forms.clc.org.au/onlinepermits/transit.aspx

Great Central Road WA section:
https://www.ngaanyatjarra.org.au/permits

Safety considerations:
First: check all sections of this road are open BEFORE travelling. The most common section to close after rain is in the Shire of Laverton, but check the Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku website for potential closures on their side as well.

Secondly: between Laverton in the west and Yulara in the east, there are no mechanics and very limited places to buy tyres. Don’t count on buying a tyre out here. Make sure you travel with 2 x spare tyres.

The Great Central Road is located on the WA side of the border, the Northern Territory side is called Tjukaruru Road.

Language / translation note:
“Tjukaruru” means straight.

History:
Prior to the construction of the Great Central Road, there was a walking track that linked Laverton, WA to the vast interior of WA. This unnamed track was used for thousands of years prior to Laverton being built. It was a walking track between tribal territories that was inspersed with rockholes that held small quantities of water. The next iteration of the Great Central Road was “Laverton to Warburton Mission Track” which carried supplies from Laverton to Warburton Mission from 1934-late 1960s. This track mirrored the ancient traditional walking track and to this day, many of the rockholes that supplied water to tribal people can still be found quite close to the modern Great Central Road. In this section, modern history has run parallel with the ancient past.

The Great Central Road was altered in the 1990s and early 2000s to remove some of the blind corners and improve safety somewhat, but on average it still retains much of the original and ancient walking track shape.

To clarify an earlier detail: supplies were trucked out from Laverton in the Mission times and once the Mission disbanded, fuel and grocery supplies were then bought in from Welshpool, WA or Alice Springs depending on which communities were receiving goods along the Great Central Road.

Until 1957, Warburton Mission Road (the precursor to the Great Central Road) only extended from Laverton to Warburton, no additional roads went east from there.

From the late 1950s, the first road originating from the east was constructed and a connecting section of this road connected Warburton and onto the East and West, it is called the Gunbarrel Highway.
The point at which the Gunbarrel diverted south through to Warburton Mission was -and is still- called Jackie Junction.

The Gunbarrel Highway only coincidentally crosses occasional sections of what is now the Great Central Road.They were constructed for entirely different purposes, with the Great Central Road being intended to carry people between communities and the Gunbarrel Highway being intended to recover “Test” rockets fired from Woomera, in South Australia as part of the “Blue Streak Rocket Program”, which was a precursor to modern intercontinental ballistic missiles.

In the 1970s and 1980s travel between Warburton and Giles (Warakurna) was becoming more common and the Gunbarrel Highway was not intended to directly connect the two communities, it went miles out of the way and wasted much fuel winding around the desert. So a new and more direct path was proposed and built by the Yarnangu (the tribal people of this region). They used a small tractor, picks, axes and shovels and constructed a new and more direct route across the Gibson Desert from Warburton to what is now Warakurna but was then known as Giles.
This was the almost final section of what is now the Great Central Road.
The road from Kata Tjuṯa to Kaltjukatjarra was already constructed but a small section of road between Warakurna (Giles), WA and Kaltjukatjarra (Docker River), NT needed to be formally connected and that became what is now the Great Central Road connecting WA to the NT via an inland direct highway, allowing easy navigation for tourists and supply trucks, compared to the previous indirect routes.",a year ago,13-05-2024,-25.3036864,130.7010627

This is crazy in my eyes, as you are limited in many ways in the resort for food choices and affordable ones at that.  They obviously want you to eat at Ilkari or the Pira Pool Bar outside, but where the minimum price is about $25 for chips at Pira, it’s not inviting.  And disappointing there is a child’s menu that is fairly priced. I actually ordered fish and chips even tho I am not under 15 years old which is stipulated.  It was the best meal I had!!! Also had crab cakes that were delicious. Cocktails good but $27.50.

Suggestion: keep Walpa open all day. The hotel is so large that you will keep more people eating here instead of venturing further.

Not that you have many options apart from what Ayers rock resort offers, but they do give options at various levels.  I would give five stars, however there are two issues here.  One is that desert gardens claim 4.5 stars which I think is ambitious.  The bathrooms are old and need an update and facilities are nice but not amazing.  I think 4 stars is realistic.  However, the price is completely crazy.  700 dollars a night.  We spent 10,000 dollars for 4 nights with over 5,000 going towards accommodation, meals and one dinner activity they offered.  The balance was flights, car hire, park fees and incidentals.  That's really steep (just the resort spend component).  But the resort was full, so I guess the market is there and they take advantage of that.

It's a large park with a pool that is way undersized for the number of people staying here, it's easy for us to see as we're on a site very close to the pool, I'd  say this is mostly due to the number of teenagers on school &/or youth camps here.

The bed was very comfy and the TV you could cast/Netflix etc.

We got there early and they text us when the room was ready. Parking was ok for us, we always got a spot closeby to our room. The pool area looked good, was too cold for us to use at this time of year, but it would be nice in summer!

We ate at the outback kiosk and had good food both times. Pizza was good and the chicken tender meal was huge. A little bit dearer than at home but that is to be expected and you don't mind paying when the food is actually good.

The gift shop had a nice range of souvenirs and snacks/ice cream/essentials etc.

I wanted to give 5 stars but the last day our room didn't get serviced, I rang at 3pm and asked if they knew if it would be done that day and the girl said they would do it between 3pm-5pm as they do new arrivals rooms until 3pm. No one came and I asked at the front desk after 5pm, the girl said the housekeeping people had finished for the day. I was able to get towels etc from the front desk, but it's more the point of it not being done.. especially when it's not cheap to stay there. Seemed odd as the day before we got back to our room at 11am and it was already done. It didn't affect our stay but just be aware of that if that's something that is necessary for you.

Showers: hot and good pressure :)
Extra activities: we did the stargazing and also the Field of Light. Loved both. Looking through the telescopes for stargazing was amazing - shame about the light pollution from the resort.

From start to finish, the process was smooth, well-organized, and highly enjoyable. The tour guides were exceptionally patient, gentle, and welcoming, creating a comfortable atmosphere for everyone. Their explanations were thorough and easy to understand, making the experience both educational and engaging. We were also very lucky to see a meteor this time, which made the night even more magical and memorable. We truly appreciated their passion, attention to detail, and willingness to answer all our questions. It was a memorable and enriching experience that we would highly recommend to anyone interested in exploring the night sky.",5 months ago,29-04-2025,-25.2410614,130.9835689
ChIJcYd5-xFBIysRMSa3x5aOTXo,Uluru Astro Tours,Yulara_Uluru,Chong Sy,5,"The Uluru Astro tour was absolutely worth it. The tour was equipped with professional stargazing gear, and our guide was incredibly knowledgeable, combining astronomy with insights from various cultures. The group was thoughtfully split into two teams—one with Chinese commentary and one with English—making it accessible for everyone. They even provided blankets to keep us warm, which was a very considerate touch. The tour also included a commemorative photo with Uluru and the Milky Way, making the experience even more memorable. Highly recommended!",4 months ago,03-06-2025,-25.2410614,130.9835689

The guides were knowledgeable and fun - great stories shared about the stars. Telescopes were really cool and the photo was fab!

This was hands down an amazing experience that I'd recommend to absolutely everyone. Our guide was truly exceptional – not only incredibly knowledgeable, sharing fascinating insights about the cosmos and local Aboriginal constellations, but also wonderfully accommodating and genuinely hilarious. They made the entire evening so engaging and enjoyable, answering every question with patience and a great sense of humor. Seeing the Milky Way from Uluru was a dream come true, and the setup was perfect. A crucial tip for anyone booking: definitely check the weather on the day of your tour! Clear skies make all the difference, and it is so worth it for the breathtaking views. Do yourself a favor and book this tour – you won't regret it!",3 months ago,09-06-2025,-25.2410614,130.9835689

ChIJmcXZPTxAIysRuDslJZszkgc,Yulara Sports Ground Oval,Yulara_Uluru,Sejko,4,"Great! I was walking home from school, I decided to go to the store and buy chips (my mom gave me money for lunch at school, but I'm smart and decided to spend the money on chips). After I bought the chips, I went home, but on the way home I saw a white van from which an uncle in a black coat got out, he came up to me and asked,
-Would you like some candy. And I told him
- Of course! What fool would refuse candy.
He gave me a candy, and also offered to take me home. I got into his van, and we drove. When I wanted to tell him where I lived, he said: Shut up! I don't know what I did to make him so angry, but I decided to keep quiet anyway.
We drove for a very long time, but it was good that I bought chips with my mom's money, so I wasn't hungry. When we arrived it got very hot, he opened the car and threw me out. Well, I didn't get lost and ran after him. But his car was very fast and I couldn't catch up with him. Overall, I liked the trip. There were only two minuses. The first was very hot (I didn't like this weather)
The second was not very comfortable conditions, but bearable.",2 years ago,30-07-2023,-25.2342596,130.9825471

Most people go right up the second lookout.
You can take some water on board to make sure the loop won’t dehydrate you.
